# Strategy Reference for the Hyphen-ated Group

Our group has come up with many different strategies. It is helpful to give specific names to each strategy to aid in both discussion and comprehension. If you know the general way we play but don't know about a specific kind of move, then you can look it up in this document.

If you are a brand new player, do not bother reading this document. It is much better to simply read the [introductory document](Beginner.md) and then start playing games with the group. This document can be used as a reference as you continue to naturally improve at the game.

If you have already read the beginners guide, then please see the [learning path document](Learning_Path.md). This explains what to learn next and how many games you should be playing before reading ahead.

Note that convention updates for the group are listed in the `#announcements` channel on the [Hanabi Discord server](https://discord.gg/FADvkJp). (You can also review the [commit history](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/commits/master) of this repository.)

## First Principles

In general, we want all of our strategies to flow from some basic principles. That way, new players can just learn the first principles, and then use logic and reasoning to find out the resulting strategy that their teammate is intending. However, there are a few wrinkles with this:

1) Some of our strategies are arbitrary and do not flow from the first principles. So take the phrase "First Principles" with a grain of salt.
2) Since the principles are a little abstract, they are more useful as a reference than as an actual guide on how to play Hanabi with our group - this is what the [introductory document](Beginner.md) is for.

<br />

### 1. Chop Principle

* The "chop" is the right-most (oldest) unclued card.
* When a player needs to discard and has no known safe discards, they should discard the chop card.

### 2. Minimum Clue Value Principle

* A given clue must either:
  * indicate sufficient information for **one or more previously unclued** cards to be played (as a *Play Clue*)
  * prevent the possible discard of **one or more previously unclued** cards that need to be saved (as a *Save Clue*)

### 3. Save Principle

* Cards that meet the following criteria must not be discarded:
  * only one copy remains (e.g. 5's or unplayed cards in the discard pile)
  * it is a 2 and not visible elsewhere in players' hands
  * it is currently playable and not visible elsewhere in players' hands
* When a card that needs to be saved is at immediate risk of being discarded, it must be indicated with a *Save Clue* (or a *Play Clue* if it happens to be playable).
* If a player receives a clue that could be either a *Save Clue* or a *Play Clue*, they **must** consider both possibilities. Specifically, this means that the player must hold on to the card until they know for sure.

### 4. Good Touch Principle

* A safe discard is defined as:
  * a copy of a card that has already been played
  * a copy of a card that is in someone's hand and has been clued
* Safe discards should **not** be clued (unless there's an important reason to).
* Players should generally assume that any clued card in their hand will eventually be played.

### 5. Play Order Principle

* When a *Play Clue* touches multiple cards, if it includes the chop, it's focused on the chop. (This is referred to as the *Chop-Focus* convention.)
* Otherwise, the clue is focused on the newest (e.g. left-most) of cards that did not have a clue "on" them already.
* The non-focused cards may or may not be playable.

### 6. Left-Most Playable Principle

* When a player is expected to play a card (or know a card is playable) in a situation not covered by the *Play Order Principle*, the card to be played is the left-most of the various cards that are most likely to be it.

### 7. Information Lock Principle

* What is indicated by a clue is determined by the known information at the time the clue is given. Subsequent clues may build upon that information, but do not override it unless a direct conflict is evident.

### 8. Good Lie Principle

* When a *Play Clue* is given, it's a message that says the card is playable. Sometimes this message can be a lie, in order to usefully manipulate other players.
* Valid lies must not allow for the possibility of any misinformed player to give a conflicting clue or misplay. In simpler terms, this means that good lies almost always reveal themselves on **the very next turn**.

### 9. High Value Principle

* The highest value clue is expected. If a clue is given, it should be interpreted to be the highest value move available to that player.
* In other words, you can draw many important conclusions from the fact that a player did not do some other (potentially higher-value) move.

<br />

## Examples

Throughout this document, there will be a mix of both text-based examples and graphical screenshots.

In a text-based example:
* The player who goes first will always be Alice.
* The second player will always be Bob.
* The third player will always be Cathy.
* The forth player will always be Donald.
* The fifth player will always be Emily.

(This is a historical convention created by [Keldon Jones](http://keldon.net/) and follows loosely from [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob).)

A screenshot will look like the following:

![Example Screenshot](img/example.png)

Note that in this user interface, players are **not** holding their hands like they would be if they were playing in real life. Every player's hand is presented in an identical way. The left-most card (slot 1) is the newest card in the hand. The right-most card (slot 4 / chop) is the oldest card in the hand.

<br />

## Level 1 - Newbie

* Level 1 strategies can be learned with no games of Hanabi played. You can either learn them before you play your first game or after you play a few games to learn the basic mechanics.
* See the [learning path document](Learning_Path.md) for general descriptions of each level.

### Chop

* As outlined in the [beginner's guide](Beginner.md#the-chop), when players have to discard, they typically discard their right-most unclued card.
* A player's chop card is formally defined as **the next unclued card that they would discard if they had nothing to do**.
* If a player has a clued card that is known useless, then they will typically discard the useless card **instead** of discarding their chop. (But the useless card does **not** count as the chop - their chop remains the right-most unclued card.)

### Play Clues & Delayed Play Clues & The Definition of Playable

* As outlined in the [beginner's guide](Beginner.md#delayed-play-clues), we treat all *Play Clues* as potential *Delayed Play Clues*:
  * If the card will successfully play on the stacks **right now**, then it was *Play Clue*.
  * If the card will successfully play on the stacks after other people have played cards of the same suit, then it was a *Delayed Play Clue* that was *through* other cards.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Donald, touching a red 1 as a *Play Clue*. This is a direct *Play Clue* - the red 1 can be played on the stacks as soon as it gets to Donald's turn.
  * Bob clues red to Cathy, touching a red 2 as a *Delayed Play Clue* - the red 2 cannot be played on the stacks as soon as it gets to Cathy's turn. Rather, Cathy must wait patiently for Donald to play the red 1 first, and then play the red 2 on her next turn.
* Since we treat all *Play Clues* as *Delayed Play Clues*, the distinction between them is pretty much irrelevant. In this document, we use the phrase *Play Clue* to mean **either** a *Play Clue* or a *Delayed Play Clue*.
* Additionally, when we say that an unclued card is currently *playable*, we do **not** mean that the card would be able to play on the stacks right this instant. If an unclued card is *playable*, then what we really mean is that it would be legal for someone to give either a *Play Clue* **or** a *Delayed Play Clue* to the card.
  * In other words, if an unclued *playable* card was given a *Delayed Play Clue*, that card would eventually play on the stack without any additional clues needing to be given by anyone else - all the in-between cards, if any, are present and accounted for.

#### One-Away-From-Playable Cards

* As noted in the previous section, sometimes unclued cards happen to be *playable*.
* Additionally, sometimes unclued cards happen to be *one-away-from-playable*.
* A card is *one-away-from-playable* if only one other card would need to be given a *Play Clue* or a *Delayed Play Clue* in order to make the card *playable*.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * No red cards are played on the stacks.
  * Bob has a red 2 with a number 2 clue on it. (It was saved with a *2 Save* clue earlier on.)
  * Cathy has an unclued red 3 in her hand.
  * Alice knows that the unclued red 3 is currently *one-away-from-playable*, because there is only one card needed in order to make it *playable* - the red 1.
* Players are **not** allowed to give *Play Clues* or *Delayed Play Clues* to *one-away-from-playable* cards - they are not playable yet!

### Save Clues

* As outlined in the [beginner's guide](Beginner.md#save-clues), you are **only** allowed to give a *Save Clue* to a card that is on chop.
* Furthermore, you are **not** allowed to give a *Save Clue* to any card you want. You are **only** allowed to give a *Save Clue* on these specific cards:
  1) 5's (with a *5 Save* clue, e.g. number 5)
  2) 2's (with a *2 Save* clue, e.g. number 2)
  3) Critical cards (with either color or number)
* Additionally, everyone in the group also agrees to never let anyone discard a (unique) playable card. However, a clue to a unique playable card would be defined as a *Play Clue*, not a *Save Clue*.

### The Early Game

* As outlined in the [beginner's guide](Beginner.md#the-early-game), the *Early Game* is the period of time before someone discards for the first time.
* Players **must** "extinguish" all of the available *Play Clues* and *Save Clues* on the board before ending the *Early Game*.
  * As outlined in the [beginner's guide](Beginner.md#3---minimum-clue-value-principle-and-tempo-clues), "extinguishing" all the *Play Clues* does **not** include giving *Tempo Clues*. *Tempo Clues* do not meet *Minimum Clue Value Principle*, so in general, they should almost never be given.

### The 5 Stall

* As outlined in the [beginner's guide](Beginner.md#the-5-stall-cluing-off-chop-5s), A *5 Stall* is when someone uses a number 5 clue to clue a previously-unclued 5 that is not on chop yet.
* *5 Stalls* are only allowed to be performed in the *Early Game* and in other special stalling situations.

### The Prompt

* The *Prompt* is a move covered in the [beginner's guide](Beginner.md#the-prompt). It is when you get a player to play a clued card that was previously unknown.
* For advanced players, also see the *[Prompts in Multi-Color Variants](#prompts-in-multi-color-variants)* section.

### The Finesse

* The *Finesse* is a move covered in the [beginner's guide](Beginner.md#the-finesse). It is when you get a player to blind-play a card to fulfill a promise that a certain card is playable right now.
* *Finesses* must be on "matching" cards. (For example, the red 1 leads directly into the red 2, so they are considered to be a "matching" pair of cards.)
* When a player is *Finessed* they should blind-play their card right away in order to demonstrate it!

#### Finesse Position

* As covered in the [beginner's guide](Beginner.md#the-finesse), a player's *Finesse Position* refers to the slot that their **left-most unclued card** is in.

<br />

## Level 2 - Novice

* Level 2 strategies should only be learned if you have played with the group a few times and have got the basics down (5-10 games of experience).
* This level builds the strategies in level 1, outlining what to do in more specific situations.
* See the [learning path document](Learning_Path.md) for general descriptions of each level.
* Level 2 subsections:
  * [Conventions & Special Moves](#level-2---novice---conventions--special-moves)
  * [General Principles](#level-2---novice---general-principles)
  * [Common Mistakes](#level-2---novice---common-mistakes)
* Head back to the [table of contents](#table-of-contents).

<br />

## Level 2 - Novice - Conventions & Special Moves

### Playing Multiple 1's - Play Order Inversion in the Starting Hand (Part 1)

* If one or more 1's in your hand are clued, **you should assume that they are all playable**. (This only applies to 1's, and follows from *Good Touch Principle*.)
* We agree that playing 1's at the beginning of the game is a special case - you should always **play the 1's in your starting hand from oldest to newest**. (This is a special case because normally, *Play Clues* mean to play the left-most card.)

<img src="img/intermediate/playing_multiple_1s.png" height="150" />

* In the above screenshot, on the first turn of the game, Alice clues number 1 to Bob, which touches three 1s on slot 2, slot 3, and slot 4.
* From *Good Touch Principle*, Bob knows that he can now play all 3 of these cards.
* Bob should play the slot 4 card first, and then the slot 3 card, and then the slot 2 card.
* The logic behind this convention is explained [here](misc/Convention_Reasons.md#play-order-of-multiple-1s).

### The Double Prompt / Triple Prompt / etc.

* Sometimes, someone can give a *Prompt* that is prompting **two** (or more) cards with one clue, which is pretty good.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * A red 1 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Cathy red, which touches a red 4. This must be a *Play Clue*, because the red 4 is not on chop.
  * Bob has two clued red cards in his hand. Since Alice has indicated that the red 4 must be playable right now, he knows that his two red cards must be a red 2 and a red 3 (in order from left-to-right).
  * Bob plays the left-most card as the red 2. On Bob's next turn, he plays the other red card as the red 3.

### The Double Finesse / Triple Finesse / etc.

* Typically, *Finesses* are performed by cluing a *one-away-from-playable* card. However, it is possible to get two different people to blind-play their cards in a row if you give a clue to a *two-away-from-playable* card. This is very efficient, as it is a 3-for-1 clue.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * A red 1 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Donald red, which touches a red 4.
  * Bob plays red 2 from his *Finesse Position*.
  * Cathy plays red 3 from her *Finesse Position*.
  * Donald plays red 4.
* Similarly, it is possible to get a single player to blind-play 2 cards in a row. In this situation, since they see that the blind cards are not in anyone else's hands, they will blind-play two turns in a row, playing from left to right.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 3.
  * Bob blind-plays red 1 from slot 1.
  * Cathy would normally think that she has red 2, which would match the red 1 that was just played. However, she sees that when the clue happened, there was a red 2 next to the red 1.
  * Thus, Cathy discards, giving Bob a chance to blind the play the red 2. If he does not blind-play it, then it was a normal *Finesse* and she has red 2. If he does blind-play it, then it was a *Double Finesse* and she has red 3.
  * On his next turn, Bob blind-plays red 2 from slot 2. Cathy now knows that she has the red 3.

### The Prompt + Finesse

* In general, remember that players will always assume *Prompts* over *Finesses*. Thus, is it possible to do a clue that *Prompts* a card from a player's hand **and then** gets them to blind-play their *Finesse Position* card on the next turn.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  * Bob has a clued red card in his hand on slot 4.
  * Alice clues Cathy red, which touches a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob knows he must have both red 2 and red 3 (in order to make the red 4 playable), but he only has one clued red card in his hand. So this must be both a *Prompt* on him and a *Finesse* on him at the same time.
  * Since *Prompts* take precedence over *Finesses*, he plays the clued red card first from slot 4. It is red 2 and it successfully plays.
  * On his next turn, Bob blind-plays slot 2 as red 3. (His *Finesse Position* at the time of the clue was slot 1, but he drew a card, and now it slid down to slot 2.)

### The Reverse Finesse

* In a normal *Finesse*, you would give a clue to a player who comes after the player blind-playing a card. (e.g. clue --> blind-play --> clued-card plays)
* If you give a *Finesse* clue to someone who gets to have a turn **before** the blind-play occurs, it is called a *Reverse Finesse*. This is more complicated than a normal *Finesse* and is harder to see. (e.g. clue --> clued player does unrelated action --> blind-play --> clued-card plays)
* Because *Reverse Finesses* exist as a strategy, before playing any cards, players should always check out everyone's *Finesse Position*. If a card in someone's *Finesse Position* is playable and "matches" the clue, then **they need to defer playing the clued card** for at least one go-around and wait to see what happens.
* If the player with the "matching" card blind-plays it, then it means that the clued card is the next card in the chain. For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Bob red, which touches his red 2.
  * Next, it is Bob's turn. Normally, Bob would think that he had the red 1, and play it immediately.
  * However, Bob also notices that on Cathy has a red 1 on her slot 1 position. Thus, he has to give a chance for Cathy to prove whether or not a *Reverse Finesse* is happening. If Cathy does not blind-play anything, then Bob should have the red 1, and he can play it on his next turn.
  * Bob discards.
  * Cathy blind-plays red 1. Bob now knows that he has the red 2.
* If the player with the "matching card" **does not** blind-play, then the clued card is probably the other copy, and can be played on the next turn. For example, in a 3-player game:
  * The setup is the same as the last example. Bob is clued red, so he suspects a *Reverse Finesse* is occurring and discards.
  * Cathy discards.
  * Now Bob knows that the red card in his hand is actually the red 1.

### The Self-Finesse

* It is also possible to perform a *Finesse* on a player by giving **them** a clue.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All of the 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 3 to Cathy, touching one 3 on slot 2.
  * Bob discards.
  * Cathy knows that this was a *Play Clue* on the 3, but there are no 3's that are directly playable. Thus, someone must have the matching 2. Since Bob discarded, Cathy must be the one who has the matching 2.
  * Thus, Cathy plays her *Finesse Position* card as **any** 2. It is red 2 and successfully plays.
  * Cathy now knows that her 3 must match the 2, so she marks her 3 as red 3.
* Note that *Self-Finesses* can be difficult to perform because the player receiving the clue will **only** consider the possibility of a *Self-Finesse* **if there are no other possibilities** for the clue. For example:
  * If the clue looks like it *could* just be a normal/direct *Play Clue* on a card, then the clue receiver will not blind-play anything - they will just play the card that was clued.
  * If the clue looks like it *could* be a *Prompt*, then the clue receiver will not play anything and assume that it is a *Prompt*. (At least, until the other player has had a chance to play the *Prompted* card.)
  * If the clue looks like it *could* be a *Reverse Finesse*, then the clue receiver will not play anything and assume that it is a *Reverse Finesse*. (At least, until the other player has had a chance to blind-play the card.)

### Fix Clues

* Nearly every clue that is given is either a *Save Clue* or *Play Clue*. One small exception to this is a *Fix Clue*, which is an attempt to "fix" an impending misplay.
* *Fix Clues* are often needed when a duplicate card is touched. Cards are not normally duplicated (which follows from *Good Touch Principle*), but sometimes someone makes a mistake, or a sequence of particular cards makes duplicating necessary. Duplicate cards will lead to misplays, so it is the team's responsibility to fix the problem and intervene before this happens.

<img src="img/intermediate/fix_clue.png" height="300" />

* In the above screenshot:
  * Before the clue was given, Alice had an unknown purple card in her hand.
  * From *Good Touch Principle*, Alice concluded that her card must be purple 5, and had planned to play it as soon as possible.
  * Bob clues number 3 to Alice, which "fills in" the purple card and reveals that it is purple 3.
  * Since Alice was just about to play this card, Alice knows that this was a *Fix Clue* and that she can now safely discard the purple 3.

<img src="img/intermediate/fix_clue2.png" height="300" />

* **A clue cannot be a *Play Clue* and a *Fix Clue* at the same time.** If you receive a *Fix Clue* and it touches other ancillary cards, none of them are necessarily playable; the primary point of the clue is to fix the impending misplay.
* In the above screenshot:
  * Before the clue was given, Alice has an unknown 1 in her hand.
  * From *Good Touch Principle*, Alice concluded that her 1 must be green 1, and had planned to play it as soon as possible.
  * Bob clues blue to Alice, which "fills in" the 1 and reveals that it is blue 1. The blue clue also touches a blue card on slot 1.
  * In this situation, Alice might be tempted to think that this is a *Play Clue* on a blue 2 in slot 1, especially considering that the slot 1 card was the only brand new card introduced in the clue (and that the focus of a clue should always be on the brand new card introduced).
  * However, the fact that the blue clue "fixed" an impending misplay means that Bob may have had no choice but to clue blue, and he may not necessarily be trying to give a *Play Clue*.
  * Alice marks the blue card as either blue 2, blue 3, blue 4, or blue 5, and discards the blue 1.

### Fix Clues (That Give No Additional Information)

* Usually a *Fix Clue* will "fill in" the card to explicitly make it known that the card is unplayable or duplicated. However, it is also possible to perform a *Fix Clue* just by cluing the card again. For example:
  * Alice clues Bob number 1 and it touches three 1's.
  * Bob successfully plays two 1's.
  * Before Bob can play the 3rd 1, Alice clues Bob number 1 again, and all the clue does is re-touch the remaining 1.
  * Now it is Bob's turn. Since he was going to play the 1 already without Alice doing anything, the clue must have some other meaning. Thus, it is a *Fix Clue*: the remaining 1 is bad, and Bob can safely discard it.
* Note that in general, giving a *Fix Clue* should wait until the card is actually in danger of being misplayed (like in the previous example). If a duplicated card is not in danger of being misplayed anytime soon, then players should defer giving the *Fix Clue* until later. This way, it gives the player a chance to figure out the duplication on their own, which can happen from time to time.
* *Fix Clues* that give no additional information only "fix" one card. For example:
  * Alice clues Bob number 1 and it touches three 1's.
  * Bob successfully plays one 1.
  * Before Bob can play the 2nd 1, Alice clues Bob number 1 again, and all the clue does is re-touch the two remaining 1's.
  * Now it is Bob's turn. Since he was going to play both of these 1's already without Alice doing anything, the clue must have some other meaning. Thus, it is a *Fix Clue*: the 1 that Bob was about to play is bad, and Bob can safely discard it. Bob skips over the 1 that he was about to play and plays the other one.

<br />

## Level 2 - Novice - General Principles

### Trash

* *Trash* cards are defined as cards that have already been played. Thus, they are useless to the team.
* Players should generally avoid "touching" trash cards with a clue, as doing so would violate *Good Touch Principle*.
  * Rarely, it can be useful to deliberately clue a trash card and violate *Good Touch Principle* in order to perform a special move. Several such moves are covered later on in this document.
* In the case where a suit is partially "dead", the unneeded cards are also considered trash. For example, if both copies of the red 3 have been discarded, then the red 4 and the red 5 are both considered trash.

<br />

## Level 2 - Novice - Common Mistakes

### Stomping on a Finesse

* This is the term used for when a player clues a card directly that was going to be blind-played from a *Finesse*. Typically, this means that the player who gave the clue was not paying attention and failed to see that a *Finesse* happened at all.
* *Stomping* on a *Finesse* essentially wastes a clue for the team.

### What to Do After a Strike / Bomb

* When a card is misplayed and goes to the discard pile, the team accumulates a *strike* (which is also referred to as a *bomb*).
* If three strikes are accumulated, the team will get a score of 0. This is to be **avoided at all costs** and players should play relatively conservatively when the team is at two strikes. (One exception is when players are explicitly going for a perfect score in a really tough variant, but this is less common.)
* Building on this concept, it can also be **very bad** to get **two strikes in a row**. For example, say that Alice performs a bad clue and Bob misplays, causing a strike. And then Cathy "still believes" the original clue (thinking that Bob was the one who made the mistake instead of Alice), and Cathy goes on to misplay, causing yet another strike.
* So, in general, we want to **isolate one mistake to one strike**. Why? Since Hanabi is so difficult, mistakes are common, and we don't want to push the team to the precipice of failure after one tiny mistake. That kind of thing is not very good for the overall win-rate.
* This means that when a strike happens, **the state of information should "reset"** back to what it was before the mistake happened, at least most of the time.
* For example, if Alice clues red to Cathy, and Bob misplays a card, then Cathy should **not** go on to play any of her red cards, and Cathy should **not** make any assumptions about what her red cards could be. Obviously, some kind of mistake happened, and Cathy should sit and wait patiently for further instructions.

## Level 3 - Initiate

* Level 3 strategies should only be learned if you have played with the group for a few days (20+ games of experience).
* This level introduces a few different kinds of Chop Moves. While Chop Moves may not be used in every single game, level 3 players should be comfortable with all of the basic forms.
* See the [learning path document](Learning_Path.md) for general descriptions of each level.
* Level 3 subsections:

## Level 3 - Initiate - Conventions & Special Moves

### The Sarcastic Discard

* Occasionally, through a mistake (or complicated situation), the same card will be clued in two different people's hands. Generally, this is to be avoided, but sometimes it happens. Handling this can be tricky.
* Generally, the **first** player who fully realizes that they have the duplicate card should discard it (as opposed to playing it or holding on to it). This is called a *Sarcastic Discard*, and it communicates to the other player that they 100% have the discarded card. (This is because normally, from *Good Touch Principle*, we never discard cards that have been clued, so if a player discards a clued card, something special must be going on.)
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * On the stacks, red 2 is played.
  * Alice has one red 3 clued in his hand with just number 3.
  * Alice clues number 3 to Bob, which touches one 3. (This is a mistake, because it might be violating *Good Touch Principle*.)
  * Bob knows that the only playable 3 is red 3. He also knows that Alice has a clued red 3 already in her hand. Thus, he knows that he has the red 3 and that Alice made a mistake.
  * Bob performs a *Sarcastic Discard* to pass the red 3 back to Alice.
* The *Sarcastic Discard* is similar to the *Prompt*, except that it is initiated by a discard instead of a clue.
* However, unlike a *Prompt*, if there are multiple cards that a *Sarcastic Discard* could apply to, then it does **not** promise that it is the left-most card. It only promises that they have the card somewhere. For example:
  * Alice *Sarcastic Discards* a red 3.
  * Bob has two cards clued with number 3 in his hand. He does not have any color information on either 3.
  * Bob can be certain that one of the two 3's is red 3, but he does not know which one it is yet.

### Playing Multiple 1's - The Fresh 1's Rule (Part 2)

* First, see [Playing Multiple 1's - Play Order Inversion in the Starting Hand (Part 1)](#playing-multiple-1s---play-order-inversion-in-the-starting-hand-part-1).
* If two (or more) 1's are clued in someone's hand, and one of the 1's was in the starting hand, and one of the 1's was not, then the "fresh" card is probably more important. (Otherwise, the clue might have been given earlier.)
* Thus, freshly drawn 1's should always be played before any 1's that were present in the starting hand.
* Continuing on from the example in [Playing Multiple 1's - Part 1](#playing-multiple-1s---play-order-inversion-in-the-starting-hand-part-1), imagine that:
  * Bob plays the slot 4 card. (He then draws a card, and all of the other cards in his hand slide over.)
  * Alice clues 1's to Bob, which touches a brand new card on slot 1 and re-touches the ones on slot 3 and slot 4.

<img src="img/intermediate/playing_multiple_1s2.png" height="150" />

* Bob knows that fresh 1's have precedence, so he plays the slot 1 card next. After that, he should play the slot 4 card, and then the slot 3 card (e.g. resuming the play order from before).

### Playing Multiple 1's - The Chop Focus Exception (Part 3)

* The *Fresh 1's Rule* has an exception: *Chop-Focus* **overrides** it.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * No cards are played on the stacks.
  * Alice discards a red 4.
  * Bob discards.
  * Cathy clues number 1 to Alice, touching four 1's on slots 1, 2, 3, and 5.
  * Alice knows that the correct order to play all of the 1's in is 5, 1, 3, 2:
    * Alice knows that normally, you are supposed to play freshly-drawn 1's before 1's that were present in your starting hand. However, *Chop-Focus* overrides this rule, so she knows that the slot 5 card (her chop) should play first.
    * After that, she uses the *Fresh 1's Rule*, and knows to play the 1 in slot 1 next.
    * After that, she will play the rest of the 1's from oldest to newest (since they were in her starting hand), so she will play slot 3 and then slot 2.

### The Chop Move

* Normally, players discard their oldest (right-most) unclued card. However, sometimes a player can know that an unclued card is very important.
* A *Chop Move* is a special kind of move that indicates to a player that the unclued card that is currently on their chop is very important.
* After the *Chop Move*, the player considers the card on their chop to be touched with an "invisible" clue. Thus, their chop will "move" to the next right-most unclued card.
* A *Chop Move* is permanent, meaning that a *Chop Moved* card should not be discarded for the remainder of the game.
* Several kinds of *Chop Moves* are listed below.

### The Trash Chop Move

* See the *Chop Move* section above for an explanation on what a *Chop Move* is.
* In the middle of a game, if all of the 1's have been played already, and someone clues a 1, this is quite strange. (From *Good Touch Principle*, players are not supposed to touch cards that have already been played.) In this situation, the 1 is considered "trash".
* The clue must have some deeper meaning. We agree that it means that the cards to the right of the trash are important. The point of the clue was to give the player a safe discard.
* However, in addition to giving a safe discard, it should also *Chop Move* **all** of the cards to the right of the trash.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All of the 1's are played.
  * Bob has a completely unclued hand.
  * Alice clues 1's to Bob, which touches a 1 in his slot 4.
  * Bob *Chop Moves* his slot 5.
  * Bob discards the 1.
  * Bob's chop is now his slot 4.
* Most of the time, the *Trash Chop Move* is done for a single card (meaning that the trash card that was clued was one-away from chop). However, you can also use the *Trash Chop Move* to *Chop Move* multiple cards. For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All of the 1's have been played on the stacks.
  * Bob has a completely unclued hand.
  * Alice clues 1's to Bob, which touches a 1 in his slot 1.
  * Bob *Chop Moves* his slot 2, his slot 3, his slot 4, and his slot 5 (a quadruple *Chop Move*).
  * Bob discards the 1.
  * Bob's chop is now his slot 1.
* This move is most commonly done with a number 1 clue because it is likely that in the middle of a game, all of the 1's will be already played. But it could also be done with a number two 2 clue if all the 2's are already played / accounted for. Or, it could be done with a red clue if all of the red cards are already played / accounted for. And so forth.
* Strategy wise, the *Trash Chop Move* is used for two main reasons:
  1) Sometimes there are multiple critical cards in a row on chop and it falls to one player to save all of them. In this situation, a multiple-card *Chop Move* could be the only way to do it.
  2) Some cards (e.g. a *one-away-from-playable* 3) are quite useful to the team, but "illegal" to touch directly (as touching them directly with a clue would imply that they are playable right now). If the game is going well, then it can be useful to "waste" a clue in order to have the card saved permanently.
* Note that you are **not** allowed to *Trash Chop Move* a card that you can just clue directly with a *Save Clue* (unless there are multiple critical cards in a row on chop and you have no other choice). This is because having some positive information is always better than having the card be a mystery.
* If a *Trash Chop Move* touches **multiple** trash cards, then it only *Chop Moves* the cards to the right of the right-most trash card. For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Bob has a completely unclued hand.
  * Alice clues 1's to Bob, which touches a 1 in slot 2 and a 1 in slot 4.
  * Bob **only** *Chop Moves* his slot 5 card.

### The 5's Chop Move

* See the *Chop Move* section above for an explanation on what a *Chop Move* is.
* Normally, we are only allowed to save 5's on chop (unless it is done with a *5 Stall* clue, which can happen in the *Early Game* and in other "stalling" situations).
* So, if a number 5 clue is performed on a 5 that is not on chop, and it is **not** a stalling situation, then it will normally look like a *Play Clue* on that 5.
* However, if the 5 is:
  * **one-away** from chop (or, if two or more 5's are clued and the right-most 5 is one-away from chop), and
  * the chop card is not a trash card
* Then, we agree that it has a special meaning, and that the clue is **not** a *Play Clue* at all.
* Instead, it is understood that the clue is a *5's Chop Move*, and the player should *Chop Move* in a manner similar to the *Trash Chop Move*.
* Note that the *5's Chop Move* is different than the *Trash Chop Move* in that you can only chop move **one** card with it. Thus, if you clue a 5 and it is **two** (or more) slots away from the chop, then it is to be assumed to be a *Play Clue* on the 5.
  * When counting how far away from chop a card is, you should only look at **unclued** cards.
* Similar to the *Trash Chop Move*, if a *5's Chop Move* touches **multiple** 5's, then it only *Chop Moves* the cards to the right of the right-most 5. For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Bob has a completely unclued hand.
  * Alice clues 5's to Bob, which touches a 5 in slot 2 and a 5 in slot 4.
  * Bob **only** *Chop Moves* his slot 5 card. Bob's new chop is his slot 3.

### Chop Moves & New Clues

* See the *Chop Move* section above for an explanation on what a *Chop Move* is.
* Once a card has been *Chop Moved* and is no longer in danger of being discarded, it is treated as an already-clued card with regards to new clues given to that hand. For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All of the 1's have been played on the stacks.
  * Bob has a completely unclued hand.
  * Alice clues 1's to Bob, which touches a 1 in his slot 4.
  * Bob *Chop Moves* his slot 5.
  * Bob discards the 1.
  * Bob's chop is now his slot 4.
  * Cathy clues blue to Bob, which touches his slot 1 (the card he just drew) and his slot 5 (the card that was just *Chop Moved*).
  * Bob knows that the focus of the clue is always on the brand-new card introduced, so this is **not** chop-focus, and the focus of the clue is on slot 1.
  * Thus, Bob will play blue 2 from slot 1 on his next turn.

### Chop Moves & Prompts

* See the *Chop Move* section above for an explanation on what a *Chop Move* is.
* *Chop Moves* interact with *Prompts* & *Finesses* in a potentially confusing way. *Chop Moved* cards should **not** be played into *Prompts*, even though they are imagined to have an "invisible" clue on them. For example:
  * All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Bob has no cards clued in his hand, but he is *Chop Moved* for a mystery card on his slot 5.
  * Alice clues Cathy red, which touches a red 3.
  * Bob knows that he is promised the red 2. If this is a *Finesse*, then he has the red 2 on his *Finesse Position* (slot 1).
  * However, Bob is also *Chop Moved* for a card. Bob knows that *Chop Moved* cards have an "invisible" clue around them, and Bob also knows that *Prompts* are said to take precedence over *Finesses*.
  * So should he play his slot 1 as a *Finesse* or his slot 5 as a *Prompt*? In this situation, Bob knows that *Prompts* do not apply to *Chop Moved* cards, so Bob should play his slot 1.

<br />

## Level 3 - Initiate - General Principles

### Information Lock Principle

#### Information Lock with the Full Identity

* As soon as a clue is given to a card, if it is enough to determine the card's full identity, then the assumed identity is said to be locked in to the card. (On Hanab Live, this is usually represented as a player writing an "identity note" on the card.)
* For example, in a 3-player no variant game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Bob red, touching a red card on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob immediately right-clicks on the card and writes a note" of "red 1".
  * This card is now "locked in" as a red 1. No future clues or actions from other players can ever change that.

#### Information Lock with a Superposition

* A *[superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition)* is a term from [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics) that describes how something can be two different things at the same time. For example, an electron is a type of a particle, and an electron can either be "spin up" or "spin down". But an electron could also be in a superposition of both "spin up" and "spin down" at the same time, as weird as that sounds. Eventually, if the electron happens to bounces off of something (e.g. is measured), then the superposition will "collapse" and it will **only** be in a "spin up" or "spin down" state. The details of quantum mechanics are not important - the main point is that we treat unknown Hanabi cards sort of like unknown particles: even though they **really** have a true identity, we ignore that and treat them as being all of the possibilities at the same time.
* As soon as a clue is given to a card that could be two or more different things, then the assumed superposition of all of the possibilities is locked in to the card.
* For example, in 3-player rainbow game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Bob red, touching a red card on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob immediately right-clicks on the card and writes a note" of "red 1 or rainbow 1".
  * This card is now "locked in" as this specific superposition. Future clues and actions can narrow down the cards in the superposition or completely collapse the superposition, but new cards can never be added to the superposition.

#### Information Lock on In-Between Cards

* As soon as a clue is given to a card that is not immediately playable, the assumed identity is locked in to the card **and** all of the in-between cards.
* For example, in a 3-player no variant game:
  * Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  * Bob has one card in his hand clued with number 2. (It is currently unknown.)
  * Cathy has one card in her hand clued with number 3. (It is currently unknown.)
  * Alice clues Donald red, touching a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob is promised to have the red 2. He writes a note of "red 2" on his clued 2. It is now locked in forever as that card.
  * Cathy is promised to have the red 3. She writes a note of "red 3" on her clued 3. It is now locked in forever as that card.
  * Donald knows that from *Good Touch Principle*, his red card cannot be red 2, since Bob has that card clued in his hand.
  * Donald knows that from *Good Touch Principle*, his red card cannot be red 3, since Cathy has that card clued in her hand.
  * Donald knows that he must therefore have the red 4. He writes a note of "red 4" on his red card. It is now locked in forever as that card.

#### Breaking Information Lock

* A direct conflict is the only thing that can "break" an information lock.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Alice has a card that is locked in as a red 2.
  * Alice receives a blue clue, which happens to touch this card.
  * It obviously cannot be a red 2 anymore, so the *Information Lock* is broken.

### Efficiency

* A big part of Hanabi is of trying to be as efficient as possible. This means that players will generally try to "get" as many cards with one clue as possible.
* If you use one clue to get one card, we refer to that as a 1-for-1 clue. For example:
  * On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Bob number 1, touching one 1 as a 1-for-1.
* If you use one clue to get two cards, we refer to that as a 2-for-1 clue. For example:
  * On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Bob number 1, touching two 1's as a 2-for-1. (Bob will play both.)
* 3-for-1 clues are even better than 2-for-1 clues, and so forth. It is even possible to perform a 9-for-1 clue with advanced techniques.
* If a clue touches two cards but only one of them will play right now, it **still counts** as a 2-for-1. This is because we assume that all touched cards will eventually play from *Good Touch Principle*. For example:
  * On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Bob red, touching a red 1 on slot 1 and a red 5 on slot 2 as a 2-for-1. (Bob will only play the red 1 and save the other red card for later.)
* On Hanab Live, the current efficiency is shown on the right side of the screen. Efficiency is calculated by the following formula:
  * `(number of cards played + number of unplayed cards with one or more clues "on" them) / number of clues given`
* **If efficiency is low, players should probably not perform 1-for-1 clues!** Instead, it is better to discard and try to let someone perform a *Finesse*.

### Tempo

* *Tempo* is a term used to describe the speed at which cards are played. (This is similar to how it is used in other games such as chess.)
* Hanabi can be thought of a race to get all the cards played before the time runs out. This means that even if the team is being extremely efficient, they can still lose the game if they are not playing their cards fast enough. Thus, players have to **strike a balance between *Efficiency* and *Tempo***. You can think of *Efficiency* and *Tempo* as the yin and yang of Hanabi.
* At the beginning of the game, there is a lot of time left, so players will generally prefer clues that get a lot of efficiency over clues that get a lot of tempo.
* At the end of the game, there is almost no time left, so players stop caring about efficiency and start caring only about tempo.
* On Hanab Live, "Pace" is shown at the right side of the screen. Pace is a measure of how many more discards can occur, so this essentially tells you how much time is left in the game. Starting pace is calculated by the following formula:
  * `current score + cards in deck + number of players - maximum score`
* Even at the beginning of the game, players might prefer a clue that gets tempo over a more efficient clue if it will prevent the discard of some other useful card. It all depends on the context of the game!

<br />

## Level 3 - Initiate - Common Mistakes

### The Wrong Prompt (Mistake)

* A common mistake in Hanabi is to attempt to perform a *Finesse* when there is a "matching" card in that player's hand. Since *Prompts* take precedence over *Finesses*, the player will always play their matching clued cards first.
* When a card is *Prompted* and it misplays, everyone can read into this mistake - it was almost certainly a *Wrong Prompt*, meaning that the player who gave the clue probably intended for the *Finesse Position* card to play instead.
* Thus, if there is nothing else special about the situation, the player who misplayed should go on to play their *Finesse Position* card on the next turn.

### Critical Discards after a Chop Move (Mistake)

* If a player *Chop Moves* a card, and then the next time they discard, they discard a critical card, then obviously some kind of mistake occurred.
* The best explanation is that the *Chop Move* was never intended in the first place.
* Thus, when this happens, the player should "undo" the *Chop Move*.

### Undoing an Accidental Chop Move (Mistake)

* Often times a player can misinterpret a clue as a *Chop Move* when it really had some other meaning. If this happens, after they discard their new *Chop*, everyone else on the team will know that an accidental *Chop Move* has occurred.
* Later on in the game, sometimes a player in this situation can retroactively realize that they have made a mistake by *Chop Moving* earlier on. They might be tempted to shift their chop back to where it is supposed to be.
* However, unless they discard a critical card (see the above section), players should generally **not ever undo a *Chop Move***, because they could be discarding a now-critical card that was not critical at the time of the original mistake. Everyone else on the team did not bother to clue the now-critical card, because they thought it was safely *Chop Moved*.

<br />

## Level 4 - Neophyte

* Level 4 strategies should only be learned if you have played with the group for a week or so (40+ games of experience).
* This level covers Double Discard situations and introduces Layered Finesses. Players at this level only tell the truth to each other.
* See the [learning path document](Learning_Path.md) for general descriptions of each level.
* Level 4 subsections:
  * [Conventions & Special Moves](#level-4---neophyte---conventions--special-movies)
  * [General Principles](#level-4---neophyte---general-principles)
* Head back to the [table of contents](#table-of-contents).

<br />

## Level 4 - Neophyte - Conventions & Special Movies

### Prompts in Multi-Color Variants

* In multi-color variants, *Prompts* apply to the card with the most positive information.
* For example, in a 3-player rainbow game:
  * Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 4 as a *Play Clue*. This is a *Prompt* on Bob for a red 3.
  * In slot 1, Bob has a card with only a red clue on it. (Thus, it can be any red card or any rainbow card.)
  * In slot 2, Bob has a card with a red clue and a 3 clue on it. (Thus, it can be red 3 or rainbow 3.)
  * Since slot 2 has more positive information, Bob should choose to play slot 2 as red 3 (instead of slot 1, the left-most card).
* Players are **not** supposed to use information from negative clues.
* For example, in a 3-player rainbow game:
  * Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 4 as a *Play Clue*. This is a *Prompt* on Bob for a red 3.
  * In slot 1, Bob has a card with a positive red clue on it. (Thus, it can be any red card or any rainbow card.)
  * In slot 2, Bob has a card with a positive red clue on it and a negative green clue on it. (Thus, it can be any red card.)
  * Even though slot 2 is technically more likely to be the red 3, Bob knows that players are not supposed to use negative information for determining which card to play into a *Prompt*. Thus, Bob plays the red 3 from slot 1.

### Double Discard Situations

* Often times in Hanabi, two players will discard in a row. However, in rare cases, this can cause a perfect score to be lost.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Alice has nothing to do. Alice discards her chop and it is a red 4.
  * Bob has nothing to do. Bob also has a completely unclued hand. Bob discards his chop and it is the other copy of the red 4.
  * Since both copies of the red 4 are discarded, it is no longer possible to get a perfect score. (The maximum score now is 23 instead of 25.)
  * Normally, someone on the team would give a *Save Clue* to Bob's red 4 before it could get discarded. But since Bob's turn was immediately after Alice's turn, no-one on the team had time to save it.
* In the above example, on Bob's turn, since Bob *could* have the red 4 on his chop, we would say that Bob is in a *Double Discard Situation* for the red 4.
* More formally, a *Double Discard Situation* is defined as when the previous player discards or misplays an unplayed card **and** the current player could be discarding the other copy of that card.
* Players agree to **never** discard in a *Double Discard Situation* if it has the potential to lower the maximum score. Instead, they must give some clue. If there are no normal *Play Clues* or *Save Clues* to give, then they are allowed to give "stall" clues, like a *5 Stall*. If there are no *5 Stalls* to give, they can even just "fill-in" some information on an already-clued card (and doing this should not cause a *Finesse*).
* Let's revisit the above example to show what Bob should have done:
  * Alice has nothing to do. Alice discards her chop and it is a red 4.
  * Bob has nothing to do (meaning that there are no normal *Play Clues* or *Save Clues* to give). Bob also has a completely unclued hand.
  * Bob's chop is his slot 5 card. Since Bob does not see the red 4 in anyone else's hand and Bob's slot 5 card has no positive or negative clues on it, it is possible that Bob's slot 5 card could be the red 4. Thus, Bob knows that he is currently in a *Double Discard Situation* for the red 4.
  * Since there are no normal *Play Clues* or *Save Clues* available, Bob looks around to see if he can give a *5 Stall*. Bob sees that Cathy has a red 5 on her slot 1, so he clues number 5 to Cathy as a *5 Stall*.
  * Cathy knows that since Bob was in a *Double Discard Situation* for the red 4, she should not read too closely into his clues. This number 5 clue must just be a *5 Stall* (as opposed to a *Play Clue* on the 5).

### The Hidden Finesse

* Sometimes, you want to *Finesse* someone with a clued card already in their hand. However, if you try to *Finesse* them, they will assume it is a *Prompt* and will play their clued card. Which means that a lot of the time, you can't give a *Finesse*, and must instead clue the card directly.
* However, what if the clued card actually is playable? In that case, you can still do the *Finesse* - they will play the *Prompted* card, see that it wasn't the card you had intended, and then blind-play their 2nd newest card on the next turn. This is called a *Hidden Finesse* because the *Finesse* was temporarily hidden by the presence of clued card.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
    * Red 1 and rainbow 2 are played on the stacks.
    * Alice clues red to Cathy, which touches her red 3.
    * Bob has a rainbow 3 clued as red in his hand and he has no idea what it is.
    * Bob sees that Alice's clue must be a *Prompt*, so he plays his red card as red 2. He is surprised to see that it is actually rainbow 3.
    * Bob knows that he really must have the red 2, and it must have been on *Finesse Position* when Alice originally gave the clue. Since he just drew a card after he played the rainbow 3, he now knows that the red 2 is on his slot 2 (the second-newest card).
    * On Bob's next turn, he blind-plays his the red 2 from slot 2.
    * In this example, the red 2 was "hidden" by the rainbow 3.

### The Layered Finesse

* Normally, a *Finesse* promises the exact copy of the card on *Finesse Position*. However, as long as all of the cards leading to the card are playable, you can still promise the exact copy of the card. We do **not** consider this to be a "lie", since the blind-playing player does indeed have the true copy of the card.
* We call this a *Layered Finesse* because the intended *Finesse* blind-play target is "layered" behind other playable cards.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/master/img/layered_finesse.png" alt="Layered Finesse Example" width="400">

* For example, in the above screenshot:
  * It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues green to Bob, touching a green 2 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Normally, Bob would think that he has the green 1. However, he also sees that this could be a *Reverse Layered Finesse* on Cathy. Thus, Bob cannot play anything right now - he must wait and see what Cathy does.
  * Bob clues yellow to Alice, touching the yellow 1 and the yellow 2 (as a *Play Clue* on the yellow 1).
  * Cathy knows that this is a *Reverse Finesse* and that she has the green 1. Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card and it is a blue 1 instead. Cathy gasps in surprise.
  * Alice plays the yellow 1.
  * Bob knows that Cathy must have been trying to blind-play a green 1. Thus, he must have the green 2, and Alice did indeed perform a *Layered Finesse*. Bob clues number 5 to Cathy as a *5 Save*.
  * Cathy was surprised that she played the blue 1 instead of the green 1. This must be a *Layered Finesse* and Cathy must really have the green 1. Cathy plays her *Second Finesse Position* and it is the green 1.

### The Clandestine Finesse

* To the player who receives a clue that initiates a *Layered Finesse*, it is usually obvious what is going on. For example, in a 4-player game:
  * Alice clues Donald about one blue card.
  * Bob discards.
  * Cathy blind-plays a green 1.
  * Donald clearly knows that this is a *Layered Finesse* on Cathy, and she will continue to play cards until she finds the blue card that matches the one in his hand.
* In other words, most *Layered Finesses* cause unrelated cards to blind-play that do not match the type of clue given.
* With that said, it is also possible to perform a *Layered Finesse* for unrelated cards that **do** match the type of the clue given. When this happens, it is hidden from the receiver of the clue, so we call it a *Clandestine Finesse* to disambiguate it from a (more obvious) *Layered Finesse*.

![Clandestine Finesse](img/clandestine_finesse.png)

* For example, in the above screenshot:
  * Alice clues number 3 to Cathy, which touches the purple 3 on slot 1 and the green 3 on slot 4. Thus, the purple 3 is the focus of the clue. This must be a *Play Clue* on the purple 3.
  * Bob knows that the purple 3 is currently unplayable, so it must be a *Finesse*. He blind-plays his *Finesse Position* as purple 2, but it is a red 2 instead and successfully plays.
  * Normally, Cathy would think that she has the red 3 on her slot 1, because the card that was blind-played matches the clue. (Number 2 matches number 3.)
  * However, Cathy also sees that Bob had a purple 2 on his *Second Finesse Position* at the time of the clue. So there is a possibility that this was a *Clandestine Finesse* instead of a normal *Finesse*. Thus, Cathy has to give Bob a chance to blind-play the purple 2. If he does not, then Cathy does indeed have the red 3. Cathy discards.
  * Alice also discards.
  * Bob was surprised that he played the red 2, but now knows that it was a *Clandestine Finesse* instead of a normal *Finesse*. He blind-plays his slot 2 and it is the purple 2 and successfully plays. (Bob knows that if he did not do this, then Cathy would go on to misplay purple 3 as red 3.)
  * Cathy plays purple 3.

### The Stacked Finesse

* If a player has been *Finessed*, then their *Finesse Position* moves right one slot, exactly like if the blind card was clued. (This is a similar concept to how the chop moves left one slot when a player is *Chop Moved*.)
* If **another** *Finesse* is performed on the player who has already been *Finessed*, it is stacking a 2nd *Finesse* on top of the first, and they are expected to blind-play the new *Finesse Position* card.
* However, because of the possibility of *Layered Finesses*, players should always blind-play their cards in order from left to right (and not jump ahead).
* In rare cases, players can determine that a *Layered Finesse* was impossible (due to negative clues or some other piece of context). In this situation, if the play order of the cards does not matter, players should always "jump ahead" and play the second card to demonstrate to the team that they "got" both *Finesses*.

<br />

## Level 4 - Neophyte - General Principles

### Urgency Principle (Playing Into Finesses as Soon as Possible)

* Normally, when a *Finesse* occurs, someone blind-plays right away. This is extremely important, because it resynchronizes the information among the team. So, as a group, we always agree to blind-play our cards are soon as reasonably possible. This is called *The Urgency Principle*.
* Thus, if you see that a player does **not** blind-play into the *Finesse*, then you know that the *Finesse* must be **on you**.
* However, there are some important exceptions:
  1) Players are allowed to **defer** playing into a *Finesse* if they are doing a *Finesse* of their own (and no-one else on the team could have done it).
  2) Players are allowed to **defer** playing into a *Finesse* if they are doing something really important, like saving a 5 on chop, giving a *Play Clue* to a card that is about to be discarded, or something along those lines.
* So, if any of the above two conditions apply, then you have to **wait** and give the player yet another turn to demonstrate whether or not they will blind-play.

### Schrödinger's Cat Principle

* Often times when you are given a clue, the card could be two or more things. For example:
  * In a no-variant game, a red *Play Clue* might indicate a red 2 or a red 3 depending on whether or not red 2 will blind-play from someone else's hand.
  * In a rainbow-game, a red clue might indicate either a *Play Clue* on a red 1 or a *Delayed Play Clue* on a rainbow 2 through another player's yet-to-be-played rainbow 1.
* After getting a clue, you should immediately mark all of the possibilities down on the card as a note.
* For all of your subsequent turns, you have to treat that card like it is **all of the possibilities** at the same time. This is a lot like the *Schrödinger's Cat* quantum physics analogy, which states a cat is both alive and dead at the same time, and you won't know until you actually open the box and look. Similarly, treat the unknown card as all the possibilities at the same time, and you won't actually know until the card is played.
* The implications of *Schrödinger's Cat Principle* is that players must be very careful. Before playing a card, they will often have to wait for everyone else to have a turn to allow for the possibility of a *Prompt*, *Reverse Finesse*, and so forth.

## Level 5 - Proselyte

* Level 5 strategies should only be learned if you have 60+ games of experience with the group.
* This level covers some more special kinds of Chop Moves and introduces the various "emergency" discards.
* See the [learning path document](Learning_Path.md) for general descriptions of each level.

* Head back to the [table of contents](#table-of-contents).

<br />

## Level 5 - Proselyte - Conventions & Special Moves

### The Order Chop Move (OCM)

* Normally, at the beginning of the game, players are expected to play their 1's from oldest to newest.
* If a player skips over their right-most 1, and there is nothing else special going on, it means that the next player should *Chop Move* one card.
* If a player skips over **two** of their right-most 1's, the message skips over the next player, and the player after that should *Chop Move* one card.
* A skip of **three** 1's means that the player three seats away should *Chop Move*, and so on.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Bob number 1, which touches three 1's. They are in slot 1, slot 2, and slot 3.
  * Bob is expected to play slot 3 (which is the oldest 1). If he plays slot 3, nothing special happens.
  * If Bob plays slot 2, he is performing an *Order Chop Move*, and Cathy should chop move one card (her slot 5).
  * If Bob plays slot 1, he is performing an *Order Chop Move*, and Alice should chop move one card (her slot 5).
* Sometimes, after getting clued about two or more 1s, a player will receive a follow-up clue that "fills in" one or more of the 1s. In this situation, playing a 1 with the full identity revealed will not cause an *Order Chop Move*. In other words, *Order Chop Moves* can only happen when a player has two or more 1s with each 1 having two or more identities.
* Besides that, there are some other common situations that do **not** imply an *Order Chop Move*. Use your common sense! Here is a short list:
  * The 1 was expected to be played from the *[Fresh 1's Rule](#playing-multiple-1s---the-fresh-1s-rule-part-2)*.
  * The 1 was expected to be played from the *[Chop Focus Exception](#playing-multiple-1s---the-chop-focus-exception-part-3)*.
  * The 1 that was played has different positive clues than the other 1's.
    * Different negative clues are ignored.
  * The 1 that was played was originally *Finessed* from a clue that happened **before** the number 1 clue.
  * The 1 that was skipped over is known to be bad from contextual information. (See the *[Stale 1's Clue](#context-clues--the-stale-1s-clue)* section.)

### Double Order Chop Move (for 3-Player Games)

* This convention only applies to 3-player games.
* In the *Order Chop Move*, players can play 1's in a certain order to *Chop Move* a specific player of their choosing.
* In a 4 or 5-player game, skipping over three 1's would *Chop Move* the player three seats away. However, in a 3-player game, this would be nonsensical, since there are only 3 players in total.
* Thus, in a 3-player game, skipping over three 1's should *Double Chop Move* the very next player.
* In the rare case where four things are skipped over, it should skip over the next player and *Double Chop Move* the player after that.

### The Scream Discard Chop Move (Deliberately Discarding Instead of Playing)

* See the *Chop Move* section above for an explanation on what a *Chop Move* is.
* The *Chop Move* outlined above is a tool to save multiple cards with one clue. However, sometimes you may not have a clue at all. One way to solve this situation is with a special kind of discard.
* Typically, discarding is a last resort. So, if you have a known playable card in your hand, you can send a powerful message to your teammate by discarding instead. This is called a *Scream Discard*. Since your teammate expected you to play the card, it is like screaming at them to let them know that things are very bad.
* The player being "screamed at" should permanently move their chop by one position.
* Furthermore, the player being "screamed at" is not allowed to discard on this turn. Instead, they must give a clue. If there are no normal *Play Clues* or *Save Clues* to give, then they are allowed to give "stall" clues, like a *5 Stall*. If there are no *5 Stalls* to give, they can even just "fill-in" some information on an already-clued card (and doing this should not cause a *Finesse*).
* Players are only allowed to *Scream Discard* for **cards that are playable or critical** (or a needed 2 that isn't seen anywhere else). (This follows from *Save Principle*.)
* Players are **not** allowed to *Scream Discard* for cards that are *one-away-from-playable*.
* Players are **not** allowed to *Scream Discard* if there was some other, less dangerous way to save the card. It is a "last resort" move.
* Sometimes, a player will discard with a known-playable card in their hand, but they are **not** intending a *Scream Discard* - it is some other special situation:
  1) It is not a *Scream Discard* if the next player **has** to generate a clue for cluing the next player after that. This is called a *Generation Discard*; see below.
  2) It is not a *Scream Discard* when the card that the player did not play was a "blind" card from a *Finesse* **and** the blind card could also be in the next player's *Finesse Position*. (When this happens, the next player will usually want to blind-play their *Finesse Position* card, since this sequence of events indicates an *Ambiguous Finesse*.)

### The Generation Discard

* Usually, if someone has a known playable card and they discard instead of playing that card, this would indicate a *Scream Discard Chop Move*.
* However, if playing the card (player 1) would cause the next player to discard (player 2) and the next player after that (player 3) to have a critical and/or playable card "ride" on chop, it is a very bad situation. Thus, the discard is **just** for the purposes of generating a clue so that player 2 can clue player 3.
* The *Generation Discard* is **only** to be used as a last resort. If player 3 has something else to do (like play a card or give some obvious clue), then player 1 should just play their card and let the card "ride" on chop.

### A Scream Discard Flowchart

[Here is a handy flowchart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/master/img/flowcharts/scream_discard_flowchart.png) for determining whether something is a *Scream Discard Chop Move* or a *Generation Discard*. (It also mentions a more advanced move called an *Echo Scream Discard Chop Move*, but you can safely ignore that for now.)

### The Tempo Clue (Re-cluing a Card to Play)

* *Tempo Clues* are defined as clues that "get" no new cards. Their purpose is to get 1 or more cards played that **already** had a clue on them.
  * If a clue is given to a card that is **already** known to be playable, then that would **not** count as a *Tempo Clue*. It would instead be a *Burn Clue* (a clue that accomplishes nothing).
* In our group, we do not generally perform *Tempo Clues*, because they do not meet *[Minimum Clue Value Principle](#2-minimum-clue-value-principle)*. However, in the following special circumstances, *Tempo Clues* have enough value to justify giving them:
  1. When it gets 2 or more clued cards to play
  2. When the clued card is "out of order" (meaning that it is impossible for a *Prompt* to get the card played)
  3. When the clued card was *Chop Moved* and it is now playable
  4. When playing the clued card would "unlock" someone's hand (see the section on *Locked Hands* later on)
  5. When the clue giver is in a situation that requires them to stall (e.g. the player is *Locked*, etc.)
* When a *Tempo Clue* touches multiple cards, the focus is on the left-most card.
  * The exception is if one of the cards was previously *Chop Moved*. In that case, the focus is on the left-most *Chop Moved* card.
* If a *Tempo Clue* touches multiple cards, it typically means that all the touched cards are playable. See the *Double Tempo Clue* section below.
* Since they are so inefficient, *Tempo Clues* done outside of the special circumstances listed above are assigned a special meaning. See the *Tempo Clue Chop Moves* section below.

### The Double Tempo Clue (Re-cluing 2+ Cards to Play)

* Typically, when a *Tempo Clue* is given that touches two or more cards, it means that **all** of the cards touched are playable in order from left to right.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Bob, which touches slot 1, slot 2, and slot 3.
  * Bob plays red 1 from slot 1. The other two red cards in his hand could be nearly anything.
  * Cathy clues red to Bob, which does not introduce any new cards, but it does re-touch slot 2 and slot 3.
  * Bob knows that this is a *Double Tempo* clue. Both must be playable in order, so he must have red 2 in slot 2, and red 3 in slot 3.
* Note that the normal "play all the cards" interpretation does not apply in some special situations:
  * when the clue unlocks a player's hand
  * when the clue got 2+ cards played in total (using cards in someone else's hand)
  * when the clue touched a *Chop Moved* card; in this situation, **only** the *Chop Moved* card is playable

### The Tempo Clue Chop Move

* See the *Chop Move* section above for an explanation on what a *Chop Move* is.
* In general, *Tempo Clues* do not follow from *Minimum Clue Value Principle*, which states that a clue must get at least 1 new card played or save at least 1 new card from being discarded.
* Thus, a *Tempo Clue* with no other purpose **must** save at least 1 new card, and the player should *Chop Move* their chop card.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Bob, which touches two cards on slot 1 and slot 2.
  * Bob plays red 1 from slot 1. The red card in slot 2 could be red 2, red 3, red 4, or red 5.
  * Cathy clues number 2 to Bob, which does not introduce any new cards, but it does "fill in" his slot 2 card.
  * Bob now knows that he has exactly red 2 on slot 2 and that this was a *Tempo Clue*. Since it does not get any new cards and only get tempo on one card in total, he knows that he should also *Chop Move* his slot 5 card.
* *Tempo Clue Chop Moves* **do not** apply in the special situations listed above where natural *Tempo Clues* are allowed.
* Normally, when two cards are retouched with a clue, it is a *Double Tempo Clue* and the player should play both cards. However, this interpretation does not apply if the second card is strictly not playable. In this situation, all players can see that since only one card is getting tempo, the interpretation of the clue should be a *Tempo Clue Chop Move*.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  * Green 4 is in the trash.
  * Bob has:
    * a green 4 on slot 3 with no clues on it yet (on chop and critical)
    * a red 2 on slot 4 with a 2 clue on it
    * a red 5 on slot 5 with a 5 clue on it
  * Alice clues red to Bob, which re-touches his slot 4 card and his slot 5 card, "filling" both of them in.
  * Bob knows that this is a *Tempo Clue*, and plays red 2.
  * In most cases, since two cards were re-touched, they should both be playable. However, Bob knows that the red 5 is strictly not playable right now. Thus, since the clue did not get any new cards and only got tempo on one card in total, he knows that he should also *Chop Move* his slot 3 card.

### The Misplay Chop Move

* Sometimes, a desirable card is on the next player's chop and it is not directly cluable. In this situation, players can cleverly use the various kinds of chop moves in order to save the card (e.g. *Trash Chop Move*, *5's Chop Move*, *Tempo Clue Chop Move*, and so forth).
* However, none of these chop moves may be available to perform. In such a situation, players can *Chop Move* a player by making them intentionally misplay a card. This works in exactly the same way as a *Trash Chop Move*, except that it the trash is not known to the player receiving the clue (and it costs the team a strike).
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  * Bob's hand is completely unclued.
  * Alice clues Bob red, touching one card on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob assumes that it is a red 3 and immediately plays the card. However, it is actually a red 4 and misplays.
  * Bob knows that if Alice is not making a mistake, then she must be trying to communicate something special. Similar to a *Trash Chop Move*, Bob can reason that multiple cards in his hand are important. He marks slot 2, slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5 as being *Chop Moved*.
* The *Misplay Chop Move* is the most costly type of chop move, so it should only be performed in a situation where no other kind of *Chop Move* would work.

<br />

## Level 5 - Proselyte - General Principles

### Lines

* During your turn, part of figuring out the best move involves looking into the future to see what the next player will do. If they discard, will it be okay? Is there some obvious clue that they will do? And so on.
* As you get better at Hanabi, you will need to do this prediction not just for the next player, but for an entire go-around of the table. And as you really get good at Hanabi, you will need to do this for as far in the future as you can reasonable predict. (Sometimes, this means 15 moves or more in the future.)
* Similar to chess, initiating a move in which you can predict the next sequence of moves is called initiating a "line".
* In post-game reviews, we will often compare and hypothetically "play through" two different lines to see which one is better.

### The All 4's Test

* According to *Save Principle*, the team must not let any critical and/or playable cards be discarded. So part of constructing a line is figuring out whether this might happen.
* When considering a line, it is not safe to assume that a player will clue anything in your hand. You should perform the *All 4's Test*: what would everyone do if I have all useless 4's in my hand? If a critical and/or playable card would get discarded, then the line has failed the test, and it is probably a bad idea.

### Discard Modulation

* Often times, either you or the player who comes after you can perform a clue. And the clue would have the same result if done by either player. So who should do it?
* One way to decide is to look at the next player's chop. Is their chop high-value, low-value, or useless? If it is high-value, then you should discard and let them give the clue. If it is low-value or useless, then you should give the clue and let them discard.
* "Stealing" clues in this way is called *Discard Modulation*. If other players are discarding to let you give all of the clues, you probably have a high-value chop.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All the 1's are played on the stacks except for the red 1.
  * It is the *Early Game*.
  * Alice plays the red 1 from her hand. (It was clued earlier with a *Play Clue*.)
  * Bob sees that from Alice's perspective, there is nothing in Cathy's hand to clue.
  * Cathy has a red 3 on chop. This is a *one-away-from-playable* card that is valuable to the team. However, it would be illegal to clue the card directly with a *Play Clue* or a *Save Clue*.
  * Alice has a red 5 on chop. According to the *Early Game* rules, someone must clue the 5 before ending the *Early Game*. However, Bob knows that as an exception, it is not required to clue the person who came immediately before you. When Alice played the red 1 and did not see anything for Bob to do, Alice was giving permission to Bob to discard.
  * Bob decides to discard instead of saving the 5 in Alice's hand.
  * Cathy clues number 5 to Alice as a *5 Save*.
  * Bob has smartly prevented the discard of the red 3, at least for a little while. This kind of strategy is called *Discard Modulation*.
* For example, in a 3-player game (a similar situation):
  * All the 1's are played on the stacks except for the red 1.
  * It is the *Early Game*.
  * Alice plays the red 1 from her hand. (It was clued earlier with a *Play Clue*.)
  * Bob sees that from Alice's perspective, there is nothing in Cathy's hand to clue.
  * Cathy has a red 1 on chop. This is a trash card.
  * Alice has a red 5 on chop. According to the *Early Game* rules, someone must clue the 5 before ending the *Early Game*. However, Bob knows that as an exception, it is not required to clue the person who came immediately before you. When Alice played the red 1 and did not see anything for Bob to do, Alice was giving permission to Bob to discard.
  * Bob decides to ignore the exception and save the 5 in Alice's hand anyway.
  * Cathy discards the red 1.
  * Bob has smartly orchestrated a line in which a useless card was discarded. This kind of strategy is called *Discard Modulation*.

### The Value of One-Away-From-Playable Cards

* In general, 3's are pretty high value, and 4's are pretty low value.
* But combined with this, cards that are *one-away-from-playable* are pretty high value, and cards that are two-away (or more) are pretty low value.
* Thus, in some situations, a *one-away-from-playable* 4 may be more valuable than a *two-away-from-playable* 3.
* According to our conventions, it is illegal to clue a *one-away-from-playable* card as the focus of the clue without it being some kind of special move like a *Finesse*. However, sometimes we still want to "save" these cards. Thus, they are prime targets for indirect saves like the *Trash Chop Move* or the *5's Chop Move*.
* However, in most cases, *Chop Moving* the valuable card just won't be possible. So in general, you should try to construct lines that protect high-value cards from being discarded for as long as possible.

### Blind-Playing Chop Moved Cards

* Often times, cards are *Chop Moved* towards the beginning of the game. Normally, once the time comes, the *Chop Moved* card will be clued directly in order to get it to play.
* However, other times, the *Chop Moved* card will sit there and will never be clued.  As the game progresses towards the end, the player with the *Chop Moved* card will learn more and more information about it. For example, they might accumulate a lot of negative clues on the card. Or, they might deduce that it is probably not any of the cards that are already played (which drastically reduces the possibilities towards the end of the game).
* A clever player who accumulates enough information about a *Chop Moved* card may determine that all of the possibilities for the card are playable. In this situation, they do not have to wait for their teammates to clue the card directly - they can simply blind-play the *Chop Moved* card and it will work, regardless of which exact card it is.
* Blind-playing cards in this manner is risky! It is fairly common for players to forgo cluing *Chop Moved* cards directly in favor of using the other copy of the card in someone else's hand. (For example, it may be more efficient to use the non-*Chop Moved* copy if it would be a 2-for-1 clue instead of a 1-for-1 clue.) Thus, there is always the chance that blind-playing a *Chop Moved* card in this manner will get a strike for the team (in the case where the other copy was used or in the case where the *Chop Move* was a mistake).
* For this reason, clever players should try to blind-play their *Chop Moved* cards if they have a pretty good chance of being playable, but only if the team has one or more strikes to spare.
* Subsequently, players should **not** clue a now-useless *Chop Moved* card to prevent a future strike. The typical strategy is to just let it be *Chop Moved* for the rest of the game:
  * In the best case scenario, the *Chop Moved* player will naturally figure out that the card is trash and can safely discard it. Or, alternatively, they will keep the card *Chop Moved*, but continue to discard other useless cards from their chop until the end of the game.
  * In the worst case scenario, the *Chop Moved* player will try to blind-play the card and get a strike for the team. But this is not guaranteed, and even if they do, they will only do it if there is a strike to spare.

## Level 6 - Rookie

* Level 6 strategies should only be learned if you have 80+ games of experience with the group.
* This level explains how to handle stalling situations.
* See the [learning path document](Learning_Path.md) for general descriptions of each level.
* Level 6 subsections:
  * [Conventions & Special Moves](#level-6---rookie---conventions--special-moves)
  * [General Principles](#level-6---rookie---general-principles)
* Head back to the [table of contents](#table-of-contents).

<br />

## Level 6 - Rookie - Conventions & Special Moves

### 2 Saves (Intermediate Section)

* As explained in the [beginner's guide](Beginner.md), *2 Saves* must be given with a number 2 clue.
  * The exception to this rule is when the other copy of the 2 is in the discard pile. Then you can do a "normal" *Save Clue* on the 2 with a color clue.
* Players are **not allowed** to perform a *2 Save* on a 2 if the other copy of the 2 is visible in someone else's hand.
  * The exception to this rule is when the same 2 is on two people's chops at the same time. In that situation, players are allowed to *2 Save* whichever one they want. And if it is the *Early Game*, then players **must** choose to save one of them before initiating the *Mid-Game*.

### The Early Game (Intermediate Section)

* The *Early Game* is introduced in the [beginner's document](Beginner.md). In short:
  * The *Early Game* is defined as the period of time before the first discard happens.
  * Players **must** "extinguish" all of the available *Play Clues* and *Save Clues* on the board before ending the *Early Game*.
* As an intermediate player, you need to know about a few extra rules about the *Early Game*. We don't bother telling the extra rules to beginners because they deal with some edge-case situations. We have the extra rules in place because we want to "squeeze" as much value out of the conventions as possible.

#### Ending the Early Game

* The *Early Game* is only ended when the first **completely unknown** card is discarded.
* In other words:
  * Misplaying a card **does not count** as ending the *Early Game*.
  * Discarding known trash **does not count** as ending the *Early Game*.
  * Doing special discards that "transfer" cards to other players **does not count** as ending the *Early Game*.

#### Extinguishing Every Clue

* Extinguishing every clue **does** include *5 Stalling*, but it is only mandatory for the team to collectively perform one *5 Stall*. If one *5 Stall* clue has already been given and there is another *5 Stall* clue available, players are allowed to clue it if they want, but they don't have to.
* Extinguishing every clue **does not** include giving *Tempo Clues* (e.g. clues that do not meet *Minimum Clue Value Principle*).
* Extinguishing every clue **does not** include cluing something in the hand of the player who came directly before. This is because the player who came before did not see anything for the next player to do, and is therefore giving them "permission" to discard. In this situation, cluing is optional; players can choose to either clue the previous hand or discard at their discretion.
* Extinguishing every clue **does not** include cluing cards that will be almost certainly be *Order Chop Moved* by an upcoming player who already has two or more 1's clued in their hand.

#### No Play Clues with a Number 5 Clue

* All number 5 clues in the *Early Game* are **never** to be interpreted as a *Play Clue*.
* Thus, if a number 5 clue is given to an off-chop 5 in the *Early Game*, then it will be interpreted as either a *5 Stall* or a *5's Chop Move*.
* If you want to give a *Play Clue* to a 5, then you can still do so, you just have to give a color clue instead of a number clue.

### 5 Stalls (Intermediate Section)

* As mentioned in the [beginner document](Beginner.md), *5 Stalls* are when a player clues an off-chop 5 purely because they want (or need) to give a stall clue.
* *5 Stalls* are usually performed in the *Early Game*. Less commonly, they can also be performed in the *Mid-Game* if a player happens to be in a special "stalling" situation where they are not allowed to discard.
* In the *Early Game*, the team can give as many *5 Stalls* as they want before initiating the *Mid-Game*.
* Regardless of whether they are done in the *Early Game* or the *Mid-Game*, *5 Stalls* are only allowed if there is nothing else "normal" to do (like playing a card, giving a normal *Play Clue*, or giving a normal *Save Clue*).
  * However, as an exception, players are also allowed to *5 Stall* if there is **only one** *Play Clue* remaining and it would touch a card on *Finesse Position*. (We refer to this as the *Finesse Position Exception*.)
  * The *Finesse Position Exception* also applies if the same card is in multiple *Finesse Positions* and there is nothing else to do.
  * The *Finesse Position Exception* applies for **all** situations in which players are allowed to *5 Stall*.
* *5 Stalls* **cannot** be given in the *Mid-Game* if there are any playable 5's. In this situation, a number 5 clue would just look like a *Play Clue* on the 5.
* *5 Stalls* **must** be given to the 5 that is closest to chop. For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the *Early Game*. The only thing left for Alice to do is to clue an off-chop 5.
  * Bob has two playable 1's on slots 1 and 2. He has a 5 on slot 4. Bob's 5 is therefore one-away from chop.
  * Cathy has nothing clued in her hand. She has a 5 on slot 3. Cathy's 5 is therefore two-away from chop.
  * Alice must clue number 5 to Bob as a *5 Stall* since his 5 is closer to chop (even though Bob has two playable cards).
* Some additional rules for *5 Stalls* are found in the section on [the *Early Game*](#the-early-game-intermediate-section).

### Allowable Stall Clues

* In certain special situations, everyone understands that a player might be giving a "stall" clue. However, there are limits - they are not allowed to just clue anything they want. These are the specific clues that they are allowed to give along with the precedence of each clue:

| Precedence | Type of Clue | Early Game (Severity 1) | Double Discard / Scream Discard (Severity 2) | Locked Hand (Severity 3) | 8 Clues (Severity 4)
| ---------- | ------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------
| 1          | Normal *Play Clues* or *Save Clues*                                                   | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔
| 2          | *5 Stall* (cluing off-chop 5's)                                                       | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔
| 3          | *Tempo Clue* (re-cluing a card to make it play)                                       | ❌ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔
| 4 (tied)   | *Locked Hand Save* (saving any card on chop and not on slot 1)                        | ❌ | ❌ | ✔ | ✔
| 4 (tied)   | *8 Clue Save* (saving any card not on slot 1)                                         | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✔
| 4 (tied)   | Filling in extra info on clued cards or *Chop Moved* cards                            | ❌ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔
| 5          | *Hard Burn* (re-cluing an unplayable card that gives no new information, usually a 5) | ❌ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔

* For example, if a player could perform a *5 Stall* (precedence 2), then they are not allowed to perform a *Tempo Clue* (precedence 3). Or, if a player could perform a *Tempo Clue* (precedence 3), they are not allowed to *Hard Burn* (precedence 5), and so forth.
  * However, remember that the *Finesse Position Exception* applies to *5 Stalls*. (This is covered in the "5 Stall" section above.)
* What is the point of having a complicated table with defined priorities? Well, normally, players in stalling situations are not able to give tricky-looking *Finesses*, because everyone else on the team will think that they are giving a stall clue. However, if it can be seen that there is a better clue available for them to give, then everyone can know that they are **not** giving a stall clue. Thus, because of this precedence table, players in stalling situations are still often able to make *Finesses* happen.
* Obviously, stall clues are not allowed when the player has a known playable card in their hand.

### Locked Hands (Severity 3 Stalling)

* Generally speaking, it is a bad situation when someone's hand gets fully clued. This is also known as being *Locked*, and it should be avoided if possible. However, sometimes it cannot be helped, like when a player draws three 5's in a row.
* A player with a *Locked Hand* may give a low-value clue because they are not sure that they can play anything (and they can't discard because their hand is fully clued). Similar to a *Double Discard* situation, players should not read too closely into any clues given during this state.
* If the team is out of clues and someone's hand is fully clued, then you **have** to discard to generate a clue for them. Similarly, if there is only 1 clue left, you cannot steal it from them.

### The Locked Hand Save (LHS)

* Players with a *Locked Hand* gain the special ability to save any card on chop (as long as it is not on slot 1). This is called a *Locked Hand Save* if it saves a card that would otherwise not be legal to save (like some *one-away-from-playable* card that is not in the discard pile yet). However, players can only do *Locked Hand Saves* if there are no higher precedence clues available. See the "Allowable Stall Clues" section above.
* A *Locked Hand Save* can be performed with either a color clue or a number clue.
* Note that the precedence of a *Locked Hand Save* is tied with a "fill-in" clue. Essentially, this means that players who have a *Locked Hand* are not forced to perform a *Locked Hand Save* if they do not want to. Most of the time, doing a *Locked Hand Save* will be pretty good (as a 1-for-1 or a 2-for-1 instead of a 0-for-1), but *Locked* players can always ignore a *Locked Hand Save* to perform a "fill-in" clue if they want.

### The Anxiety Play (Forcing a Locked Player to Play)

* Sometimes, someone with a *Locked Hand* has a playable card, but they do not know that they can play it yet. Re-cluing the card would signal this, but that would waste a clue and not be very efficient.
* A better way to signal this information is to deliberately leave them at 0 clues. By convention, this means that one of their cards is actually playable. The player should play the card in their hand that is most likely to be playable. If there is more than one option, then they should know that the left-most is playable. (This follows from *Left-Most Playable Principle*.)
* This is called an *Anxiety Play* because you are putting the *Locked* player in a "do or die" situation.

### Clues Given While at 8 Clues & The 8 Clue Save (Severity 4 Stalling)

* At the beginning of the game, you start with 8 clues. This section only applies to situations where you climb to 8 clues in the middle of the game.
* A player who has a turn with 8 clue tokens available may give a low-value clue because they cannot play anything (and they cannot discard because the game does not allow you to discard while at 8 clues). Similar to a *Double Discard* or a *Locked Hand* situation, players should not read too closely into any clues given during this state.
* Players at 8 clues gain the special ability to save any card that they want, on **or** off chop, as long as the card is not on slot 1. This is called an *8 Clue Save*. However, similar to a *Locked Hand Save*, they can only do this if there are no higher precedence clues available. See the "Allowable Stall Clues" section above.
  * Subsequently, clues that are focused on slot 1 cards are treated as normal *Play Clues* or normal *Save Clues*.

### The Distribution Clue

* In the *End-Game*, when a player has many playable cards, there is the risk that they will not be able to play all cards before the end of the game.
* Thus, it might make sense to spend a clue to duplicate one of their playable cards in someone else's hand. This would violate *Good Touch Principle*, but it would relieve the player with the loaded hand from some of the card-playing burden.
* Since it distributes plays more evenly throughout the team, this is called a *Distribution Clue*. *Distribution Clues* better satisfy *Team Distribution Principle*.

<br />

## Level 6 - Rookie - General Principles

### Misplay Cost Principle

* On a turn where a player misplays and accumulates a strike for the team, they could have discarded instead and generated a clue.
* So, if you can spend one clue to stop one misplay, the value comes out even.
* Thus, since there are only 2 strikes allowed and accumulating strikes limits flexibility, it is almost always worth it to spend one clue to stop one strike.
* If it would require two clues to stop an impending misplay, then as long as the strike would not lose the game, it is usually best to let the player misplay the card and get a strike.

### Team Distribution Principle

* In general, it is better for useful cards to be distributed **evenly** throughout the team. This is especially important in 5-player games.
* Thus, if one of your teammates has 3 out of 4 cards clued, it may be better for **them** to be the one giving the clues, and you to be the one discarding - even if their chop is known trash.
* There are multiple reasons for this. First, you don't want them to get a *Locked Hand*, which is generally bad. Second, if they continue to draw playable cards, the game may end before they get a chance to play them all.

### End-Game Threshold (End Game)

* Towards the end of the game, the strategy of the team will change. In most games, you stop becoming concerned with efficiency and become more concerned with tempo - every card needs to play **right now** before the game ends!
* Thus, since clues can mean different things depending on whether you are in the *Mid-Game* or the *End-Game*, you need to be able to keep track of when the *End-Game* has arrived.
* *Pace* is used to determine *End-Game* status. If pace is **less than the number of players**, the *End-Game* has arrived.
  * On [Hanab Live](https://hanab.live), pace will turn yellow when this occurs.
* If pace is **less than the number of players / 2**, you should be very careful with discarding. It might still be the best thing to do, but if there are enough clues in the bank, it is usually better to *Burn* a clue (meaning to deliberately waste a clue).
* If pace is 0, no more discards can happen in order to get the maximum score.
* If pace is below 0, it is impossible to get the maximum score.

### The Pace +1 Rule

* Players can use *Pace* to determine if it is safe to discard. In general, a group can discard down to pace 0 and still get a perfect score.
* However, as a rule, if pace is +1 and one of the players on your team **does not** have any playable cards, then you cannot discard - **you must let them perform the final discard**.
* If both you and another player do not have any playable cards, then you can do the final discard - the team won't be able to get a perfect score anyway. But if you **could** have an unknown playable card in your hand, then you should be very careful about discarding, because it could ruin a perfect score.

### Burning (End-Game Stalling)

* In the *End-Game*, often times there are still a lot of cards yet to be played. Thus, you need to be very careful when discarding, since by drawing a card you can make the game end before everyone has a chance to play all of the cards.
* If there are enough of clues available, you can choose to stall, by giving a low-value (or even a completely useless) clue. This is referred to as *Burning* a clue.
* The best way to give a useless clue is to re-clue cards which are already known to be playable.
* Give a *Burn Clue* if:
  * There is a possibility that the game can be completed without anyone discarding from now on.
  * You have two or more useful cards in your hand, and you want to follow *Team Distribution Principle*.
* Do not give a *Burn Clue* if:
  * The end-game has not started yet (see the *End-Game Threshold*).
  * You know that someone else will have to discard in the future.

## Level 7 - Apprentice - Conventions & Special Moves

### The Sarcastic Finesse

* Imagine that in a 3-player game:
  * Nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice has an already-clued 2 in her hand. She has no idea what color 2 it is.
  * Alice performs a *Finesse* by giving a red color *Play Clue* to a red 2 in Cathy's hand.
  * Bob blind-plays red 1 from his *Finesse Position*.
  * Normally, Cathy would think that she has the next red card, which is red 2, and play it.
  * However, what if Alice actually has the red 2? In this situation, Cathy is expected to perform a *Sarcastic Discard*.
* Doing a *Finesse* that potentially duplicates a card in this way is called a *Sarcastic Finesse*. Normally, potentially duplicating a card is bad - it violates *Good Touch Principle* and could lead to a clue being wasted. However, potentially duplicating a card with the *Sarcastic Finesse* is not bad because:
  * In the best case, you get a "true" *Finesse* (a 2-for-1 or better).
  * In the worst case, you get a 1-for-1 and full knowledge on a clued card in your own hand that was previously a mystery.

### The Gentleman's Discard

* First, read the section on the *[Sarcastic Discard](#the-sarcastic-discard)*.
* To review, the *Sarcastic Discard* is:
  1) a move that transfers a **clued card** in one person's hand to a **clued card** in another person's hand
  2) **necessary** to eliminate confusion among the team (because from *Good Touch Principle*, we are not normally supposed to have two copies of the same card "touched" with a clue)
  3) done with both playable cards and non-playable cards
* It is also possible to "transfer" cards to other players *Finesse Position*. This is called a *Gentleman's Discard* to signify that the other card was completely blind as opposed to having a clue on it already.
* The *Gentleman's Discard* is:
  1) a move that transfers a **clued card** in one person's hand to the ***Finesse Position*** of another person's hand
  2) **not necessary** and does not directly help the team, but may have some helpful side effects
  3) done with **only playable cards**
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching one 1.
  * Bob clues red to Cathy, filling in the already-touched 1 as red 1, as well as touching a new card, which must be red 2.
  * Cathy discards the known red 1 as a *Gentleman's Discard*.
  * Alice blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card as red 1.
* Often times, doing a *Gentleman's Discard* will delay things and cost the team *Tempo*. Thus, a *Gentleman's Discard* that slows things down is only good if there is some other side benefit to offset the lost *Tempo* (such as delaying the discard of a valuable card, for example).
* Just like how *Prompts* take precedence over *Finesses*, *Sarcastic Discards* take precedence over *Gentleman's Discards*.
* For the purposes of *Priority*, *Gentleman's Discards* do not count as a blind-play. (*Priority* is a concept that is introduced in a later level.) This is because the *Gentleman's Discard* is an information-symmetric move and nothing needs to be "proven" to other members of the team.

### The Layered Gentleman's Discard

* One great reason to want to do a *Gentleman's Discard* is if the card you are discarding is also behind playable cards. This is similar to a *Layered Finesse*, only it was initiated by a discard instead of a clue.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching one 1.
  * Bob clues red to Cathy, filling in the already-touched 1 as red 1, as well as touching a new card, which must be red 2.
  * Cathy discards the known red 1 as a *Gentleman's Discard*.
  * Alice blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card as red 1, but it is green 1.
  * Alice knows that she is promised the red 1, so she will blind-play her slot 2 on her next turn.

### The Baton Discard

* When a *Gentleman's Discard* happens, it transfers a playable card to someone else's hand. But players are also allowed to transfer unplayable cards that they happen to know the full identity of. We call this a *Baton Discard* to distinguish it from the more-ordinary *Gentleman's Discard*.
* Just like a *Gentleman's Discard*, a *Baton Discard* promises that the card is exactly on someone else's *Finesse Position*.
* For example, this would be a *Gentleman's Discard* in a 3-player game:
  * Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice discards a red 3.
  * Bob does not have any clued cards in his hand.
  * Bob looks at Cathy's hand and does not see the red 3. Thus, he knows that he has it.
  * Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card and it is the red 3 and successfully plays.
* For example, this would be a *Baton Discard* in a 3-player game:
  * Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice discards a red 3.
  * Bob does not have any clued cards in his hand.
  * Bob looks at Cathy's hand and does not see the red 3. Thus, he knows that he has it.
  * Bob marks his *Finesse Position* card as red 3. For now, Bob does not have anything else to do, so he discards his chop card.
* Note that it is illegal to perform a *Layered Baton Discard*; the card **must** be exactly in *Finesse Position*.
* *Baton Discards* are mostly useful for two main reasons:
  1) To better satisfy *Team Distribution Principle*. It makes sense to transfer a card out of a locked / almost locked hand to a player with an "empty" hand or a hand that only has one card clued in it.
  2) You want to protect your own chop. If you discard your chop, the team could be losing some high-value *one-away-from-playable* card. But if you transfer a card to someone else, it gives you something "safe" to do.

### The Certain Finesse & The Certain Discard

* Imagine that in a 3-player game:
  * Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice has an already-clued red card in her hand. It has a negative 4 clue on it, so from *Good Touch Principle* Alice knows that it is either red 3 or red 5.
  * Alice performs a *Reverse Finesse* by giving a red color *Play Clue* to a red 4 in Bob's hand.
  * Bob discards.
  * Cathy knows that she is promised the red 3 in her *Finesse Position*.
* This is an example of a *Certain Finesse* - it is similar to the *Sarcastic Finesse* above, but the "blind" card was potentially duplicated instead of the clued card.
* In this situation, if Alice really has the red 3, Cathy is allowed to blind-discard their *Finesse Position* card. This is called a *Certain Discard*, because Cathy can be certain that it is exactly red 3.
* A separate way to explain this convention is that everyone agrees that performing a *Layered Finesse* on a card that could potentially be clued in your own hand is illegal. So, everyone can be certain that they can safely blind discard a card to pass it back to someone who potentially duplicated. (*Layered Finesses* are an advanced type of *Finesse* that was explained above.)
* Note that players are **only allowed** to do a *Certain Discard* if they know they have not been *Bluffed*. This means that *Certain Finesses* **cannot be performed** from *Bluff Seat*. (*Bluffs* are an advanced kind of move that is covered later on.)

### The Composition Finesse

* Sometimes, a move can be both a *Sarcastic Finesse* and a *Certain Finesse* at the same time. When this occurs, it is called a *Composition Finesse*.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice has a card in her hand with a red clue on it. It could be either red 3, red 4, or red 5.
  * Alice clues red to Bob, touching a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob discards.
  * Cathy knows that she has the red 3 on her *Finesse Position* (as a *Certain Finesse*). She can *Certain Discard* it if Alice has the red 3. But Alice does not have the red 3, so Cathy blind-plays the red 3.
  * Alice discards.
  * Bob knows that his red card is a red 4 (as a *Sarcastic Finesse*). He can *Sarcastic Discard* it if Alice has the red 4. But Alice does not have the red 4, so Bob plays the red 4.

<br />

## Level 7 - Apprentice - General Principles

### Context

* If you are reading this section, you are presumably a more-experienced Hanabi player who has the fundamentals down. So, now is a good time to clear up a potential misconception that you may have about the Hyphen-ated conventions (and this reference document more generally).
* Up until now, you may have the impression that the group has a lot of conventions, and that if you just memorize all of the conventions, you will become a really good Hanabi player. Or, you may have the impression that the conventions are like laws and that you must always follow them. Neither of these things are true.
* *Context* is defined as all of the meta-information about the game state. In intermediate and expert games, when determining what a clue means, players must **always** take into account the full context of the game. This means that figuring out what a clue means is never truly as easy as following one of the flowcharts from the reference document.
* When writing the reference document, it would be distracting to constantly write the word "probably" and to constantly write "this may not apply in all situations" all over the place. For advanced players, this is obvious - Hanabi is complicated enough such that every convention is meant to be broken if the particular situation demands it.
* Thus, players need to read the reference document with **a grain of salt**, especially when it says the word "always". Even though the reference document outlines the "correct" thing to do in a lot of situations, these are not hard and fast rules. Rather, they are intended to show the "default" or "common" case. Memorizing the default cases is really helpful, for intermediate and advanced players alike. But players have to always remember to keep their brain fully engaged on the particular situation.

<br />

## Level 7 - Apprentice - Common Mistakes

### The Double Gentleman's Discard (Illegal)

* Normally, when a player performs a *Gentleman's Discard*, they know the **exact** identity of the card that they are discarding.
* However, sometimes a *Gentleman's Discard* can occur where, from your perspective, the card could have been two different things. Does this mean that the *Gentleman's Discard* "gets" **both** of the cards?
* No, it does not. By convention, even if it looks like the player could not have known the true identity of the card, the *Gentleman's Discard* only gets the specific other matching card. (The reason for this is that it allows players to act upon asymmetric information.)
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Red 1 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Bob number 2, which touches a red 2 on slot 1. This is a *Play Clue* on the 2. Thus, this is a globally known red 2 or blue 2. Alice right-clicks the card and writes a note of "r2, b2".
  * Bob also writes a note of "r2, b2", but then stops to think a little deeper. He notices that Alice has a blue 3 in her hand, so it might have been possible for Cathy to perform a *Finesse* on a hypothetical blue 2 in his hand.
  * Bob rewinds to the beginning of the game and re-plays through all of the turns, watching closely to see if Cathy had an ample opportunity to perform a *Finesse* on a blue 2. Indeed, he finds that Cathy had one or two turns where she could have easily performed a *Reverse Finesse*, but discarded instead.
  * Thus, Bob knows that it must be a red 2, so he updates his "r2, b2" note to "r2".
  * Bob sees that Cathy has a red 2 on her *Finesse Position*, so he performs a *Gentleman's Discard* by discarding the red 2.
  * Cathy blind-plays the red 2 from her *Finesse Position*.
  * Alice gasps in surprise, because Bob could not have possibly known that it was exactly a red 2. This must be a *Double Gentleman's Discard*, calling for both red 2 and blue 2. Alice blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card, hoping to play a blue 2, but instead plays a red 5, losing the game.
  * Alice forgot that *Double Gentleman's Discards* were expressly illegal because it is possible for players to have asymmetric information about the current game state.

<br />

## Level 8 - Intermediate - Conventions & Special Moves

### The Bluff

* *Finesses* are quite efficient. So, when you see a playable card in someone's *Finesse Position* slot, you will often want to "get" the card with a *Finesse* (instead of cluing it directly). However, often times, the proper "connecting" card is not on the table.
* In this situation, you can perform an alternate strategy by lying to the next player. By cluing an unrelated, *one-away-from-playable* card, the next player will think that it is a *Finesse* and that they have the matching card. Then, they will blind-play their *Finesse Position* card. This is called a *Bluff*.
* After the card is blind-played, the player who received the clue will realize that something strange has happened - the type of clue **did not match** the card that was blind-played. Thus, the clued card is not currently playable and must be a *one-away-from-playable* card.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All the 2's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Cathy red, which touches a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Next, it is Bob's turn. Bob sees that, with this red clue, Cathy has just been signaled that she has the red 3.
  * From Bob's perspective, this looks like a *Finesse* - if Bob does not blind-play the red 3 right now, Cathy will go on to misplay the red 4 as the red 3.
  * Bob blind-plays his slot 1 card. However, it is not the red 3, it was the blue 3! Now Bob knows that he has been *Bluffed* by Alice.
  * Next, Cathy sees that Bob just blind-played a blue 3 immediately after this red clue, so she knows that she must have a *one-away-from-playable* red card - the red 4. Cathy holds on to the red 4 for later and discards.
* Except in rare circumstances, ***Bluffing* is only permissible when you are the person directly before the player who is blind-playing a card**. This is called being in *Bluff Seat*. Do not *Bluff* unless you are in *Bluff Seat*! (This follows from *[Good Lie Principle](#8-good-lie-principle)*.)

### How to Tell the Difference Between a *Finesse* and a *Bluff* (Part 1) - Recognizing *Finesses* on Other Players

* Sometimes, a player will give a clue that looks like it could be either a *Finesse* or a *Bluff*. Between these two moves, which should have precedence?
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * All of the 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Cathy has a blue 2 on her *Finesse Position*.
  * Alice clues blues to Donald, highlighting a blue 3 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Now, it is Bob's turn.
* What to think **depends** on whether you are Bob or whether you are someone else on the team.
* First, let's consider the case of Bob, the very next player. Bob should **always assume a *Finesse* over a *Bluff***. From his perspective:
  * Bob knows that if this is a *Finesse*, then Cathy will blind-play the blue 2, and then Donald will know that he has the blue 3. If this is the case, Bob should not do anything special.
  * Bob also knows that if this is a *Bluff*, then Bob should blind-play his *Finesse Position* card immediately.
  * Bob knows that if there is any way that this could be a *Finesse* (the truth), he should **assume that the truth is being told**. Thus, Bob knows that it must be a *Finesse* on Cathy and should not blind-play anything.

### How to Tell the Difference Between a *Finesse* and a *Bluff* (Part 2) - *Bluffs* Are on "Mismatched" Cards

* With the previous section in mind, let's switch examples and assume that Alice did a clue and then Bob blind-played a card.
* So secondly, we can consider the case of Bob **after** he has blind-played a card, which also extends to the rest of the team. How does everyone know whether Alice did a *Finesse* or a *Bluff* on Bob?
* The way to find out is to look at **whether the card that blind-played "matches" the clue that was given**. If the clue matches, then it is a *Finesse*. If the clue did not match, then it is a *Bluff*.
* If it is ambiguous whether or not the card matches, then the team should **assume a *Bluff* over a *Finesse***. (Note that this is the **opposite** of the precedence in part 1!)
* Example 1 (color match):
  * Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Cathy red, touching a red card as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob blind-plays a red 2.
  * This must be a *Finesse*, because **red matches red**. So Cathy should think that she has the red 3.
  * This is a textbook *Finesse*; it can't get any more basic than this.
* Example 2 (color mismatch):
  * Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Cathy red, touching a red card as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob blind-plays a blue 1.
  * This must be a *Bluff*, because **blue does not match red**. So Cathy should think that she has the *one-away-from-playable* red card, the red 3.
  * This is a textbook *Bluff*; it can't get any more basic than this.
* Example 3 (rank match):
  * Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Cathy number 4, touching a 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob blind-plays the red 3.
  * This must be a *Finesse*, because **3 matches 4**. So Cathy should think that she has the red 4.
* Example 4 (rank mismatch):
  * Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Cathy number 4, touching a 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob blind-plays the blue 1.
  * This could be a *Triple Finesse* (on blue 1 + blue 2 + blue 3 into blue 4) or it could be a *Bluff* (on just blue 1 into red 4).
  * However, this must be a *Bluff*, because **1 does not match 4**. So Cathy should think that she has the *one-away-from-playable* 4, the red 4.
  * The point of example 5 is to show that because a 2 happens to be played on the stacks, the blue 4 is a *one-away-from-playable* card and therefore becomes a legal *Bluff* target.
* Example 5 (rank mismatch where a *Bluff* is impossible):
  * This is a 4-player game.
  * Nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Donald number 4, touching a 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob blind-plays the red 1.
  * Cathy discards.
  * Donald needs to evaluate whether or not Alice's clue is a *Finesse* or a *Bluff*. However, he knows that it **cannot** be a *Bluff*, because there are no *one-away-from-playable* 4's. So even though **1 does not match 4**, this must be a *Finesse*, because Alice is not allowed to perform a *Bluff* with any card that she wants.
  * Donald does not see any other red cards in Bob's hand. So Donald should think that he has the red 4, because that would match the blind-play of a red 1. Subsequently, Donald must have red 2 on his *Finesse Position* and red 3 on his *Second Finesse Position*.
* Example 6 (rank match where a *Finesse* is impossible):
  * Red 2 and blue 2 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Cathy number 4, touching a 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob blind-plays the blue 3.
  * Normally, Cathy would think that this is a *Finesse*, because **3 matches 4**, meaning that Cathy's 4 is the blue 4.
  * However, Cathy notices that her 4 has a negative blue clue on it. Thus, it cannot be the blue 4.
  * This must instead be a *Bluff*. Cathy marks her 4 as the red 4 (since red 4 is the only other *one-away-from-playable* 4).
* Example 7 (color match and rank mismatch):
  * This is a 4-player game.
  * Nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Donald red, touching a red 3 as a play clue.
  * Bob blind-plays the red 1.
  * Cathy notices that Donald's red card has a negative 2 clue on it. This means that Donald will not go on to misplay the card as the red 2.
  * Cathy needs to evaluate whether or not Alice's clue is a *Finesse* or a *Bluff*. If this is a *Double Finesse*, then Cathy needs to blind-play the red 2. If this is a *Bluff*, then Alice only intended for Bob to blind-play.
  * Cathy knows that since **red matches red**, this must be a *Double Finesse*, so Cathy blind-plays the red 2 into the red 3.
* Example 8 (color match with rainbow):
  * This is a game with a rainbow suit. (The other examples in this section assume a "No Variant" game.)
  * Rainbow 1 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Cathy red, touching a red card as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob blind-plays a rainbow 2.
  * This must be a *Finesse*, because **red matches red** (rainbow cards match every color). So Cathy should think that she has the rainbow 3.
* Example 9 (color match with rainbow where a *Finesse* is impossible):
  * This is a game with a rainbow suit. (The other examples in this section assume a "No Variant" game.)
  * Rainbow 1 and red 2 are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Cathy red, touching a red card as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob blind-plays a rainbow 2.
  * Normally, Cathy would think that this is a *Finesse*, because **red matches red** (rainbow cards match every color), meaning that Cathy's 4 is the rainbow 4.
  * However, Cathy notices that her 4 has a negative blue clue on it. Thus, it cannot be the rainbow 4.
  * This must instead be a *Bluff*. Cathy marks her 4 as the red 4 (since the red 4 is the *one-away-from-playable* red card).

### Bluffs Through Already-Clued Cards

* It is also permissible to *Bluff* "through" cards that are already clued. This can be better than a normal *Bluff*, because in addition to getting the blind-play, it also can give information to the player with the in-between card.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Bob has nothing clued in his hand.
  * Cathy has a red 3 clued in her hand with just a number 3. She does not know what color it is.
  * Alice clues Donald red, which touches one red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob knows that he must have the red 2. If he blind-plays the red 2 (as a *Finesse*), then Cathy will play the red 3 (as a *Prompt*), and Donald will play the red 4.
  * Bob plays his *Finesse Position* card as red 2. Instead, it is a blue 2 and it successfully plays.
  * From Cathy's perspective, she knows that the red 4 is *two-away-from-playable* instead of *one-away-from-playable*. *Bluffs* on *two-away-from-playable* cards are normally illegal. Thus, Cathy's mystery 3 must be exactly red 3, making the red 4 *one-away-from-playable* after all.
  * Cathy discards.
  * From Donald's perspective, since red (the type of clue that was given) does not match blue (the card that was blind-played), this must be a *Bluff*. Normally, since the red 1 is currently played on the stacks, Donald would think that he has the red 3 (e.g. the *one-away-from-playable* red card).
  * However, Cathy already has a clued red 3 in her hand. If Donald also had a red 3, then Alice's clue would be violating *Good Touch Principle*. Thus, Donald must have the red 4 instead.
* Sometimes, the player who has the in-between card might have more than one "matching" clued card. In this situation, the player is promised that they have the in-between card, but they are not promised the position - it can be any of the matching clued cards.

## Level 8 - Intermediate - General Principles

### Guide Principle

* Part of Hanabi involves making sure that if you perform an action, someone else on the team won't discard anything important (*Save Principle*). Additionally, part of Hanabi involves accounting for all the possibilities (*Schrödinger's Cat Principle*).
* Combined, these two principles usually result in players taking the most conservative possible approach, even if a certain action would have a very low risk of losing the game.
* One exception to the above rules is when Bob does not know whether or not a *Finesse* or *Bluff* is occurring. For example, in a 3-player game:
  * No cards are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 2 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob does not see any red 1's in anyone else's hand. Thus, Bob knows that Alice intends for him to blind-play a card.
  * From Bob's perspective, it can be either a *Finesse* (on exactly red 1) or a *Bluff* (on the 1 of any of the other suits).
  * Cathy also has a critical 5 in chop.
  * If this is a *Finesse*, then Bob will blind-play the red 1, and Cathy will play the red 2. If this is the case, Cathy will never be at risk of discarding the 5 and losing the game.
  * If this is a *Bluff*, then Bob will blind-play some other 1, and Cathy will have nothing to do. If this is the case, then Cathy could discard and the team could lose the game.
  * Should Bob risk blind-playing or should he save the 5?
* In this example, it follows from *Save Principle* that Bob should "play it safe" and give a *5 Save* to the 5 and *then* try to blind-play the red 1 on the next turn.
* However, Bob also knows from *Good Lie Principle*, lies have to resolve immediately. If Bob saved the 5, and then blind-played on the next turn, and it turned out to be a *Bluff*, then the lie would not have resolved immediately. Thus, from *Good Lie Principle*, Bob can assume that this is a *Finesse*.
* Stated in a different way, Bob has to trust that Alice is successfully "guiding" the rest of the team with the line that she has chosen. This means that Bob is going to play exactly red 1 into the red 2. Alternatively, it could also be the case that it is a *Bluff*, but Cathy will not discard, and will clue some card in Bob's hand. Either way, the 5 will be safe. This is called *Guide Principle*.

### Clue Interpretation & Occam's Razor

* First, see the section on [Schrödinger's Cat Principle](#schrödingers-cat-principle).
* When a clue could have multiple interpretations, usually *Schrödinger's Cat Principle* is involved - players must wait a round and see what their teammates do in order to find out the true meaning of the clue. But what if a clue could have multiple interpretations and a player does **not** have to wait for information from anyone else?
* For example:
  * Alice gives a weird clue to Cathy.
  * Bob does not see any "matching" cards in anybody else's hands, so he can rule out a *Prompt* and he can rule out a *Reverse Finesse*.
* In this situation, we would say that Bob is the *reacting player*. If a *reacting player* does not "react" to a clue in some demonstrable way, then someone else on the team will go on to misplay a card. So, the *reacting player* has to immediately decide what the clue means and perform the resulting action.
  * In some situations, there can be two *reacting players* in a row. For example, if Alice clues a *two-away-from-playable* card, then Bob must react **and** Cathy must react.
* So how does a *reacting player* figure out what the clue means? They should use *Occam's Razor* - always assume the simplest possible interpretation.

1) Assume a direct *Play Clue* or a *Delayed Play Clue* (if it could be possible that no *Prompts* & no blind-plays are involved).
2) Assume a *Prompt* (if it could be possible that no blind-plays are involved).
3) Assume a *Finesse* (or a *Prompt* + *Finesse*) over a *Bluff*.
4) Assume the "move" that results in the least number of blind-plays.
    * In general, this means assuming a one-blind-play *Bluff* over a two-blind-play *Finesse*. But keep in mind that only certain cards are legal *Bluff* targets - you can't just do a *Bluff* with any card.
5) Assume the "move" that results in the least number of *Prompts*.
    * This means that if something could be either a one-blind-play *Finesse* **or** a one-blind-play *Finesse* with a *Prompt* involved, then the pure *Finesse* is simpler and you should assume that.

<br />

## Level 8 - Intermediate - Common Mistakes

### Bluff Seat and the Pang of Guilt

* As mentioned in the section on *Bluffs*, you are in *Bluff Seat* for a certain player if you are immediately before them.
* Before cluing a card directly, you should first consider if it is on *Finesse Position*. If it is, and you clue it directly, you may be "stealing" someone's *Finesse* or *Bluff*.
* Thus, in this situation, it may be better to discard and let the player in *Bluff Seat* get the card. If you do decide to clue the card directly, you should always feel a *Pang of Guilt*.
* To tell the difference between a *Layered Finesse* and a *Bluff*, simply look at the *Bluff Seat*:
  * If the player was in *Bluff Seat*, then it is a *Bluff*.
  * If the player was not in *Bluff Seat*, then it is a *Layered Finesse*.

### Bluff Prompts / Prompt Bluffs (Illegal)

* It is illegal to trick players into thinking that they are *Prompted*. *Prompts* **must** be the truth.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * Red 1 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
  * Bob has a clued 2 in his hand and does not know its true identity.
  * Alice clues red to Donald, touching a red 3 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob knows that this must be a *Prompt*, so his 2 must be red 2. He plays it, and it is instead the blue 2.
  * Cathy is slightly surprised that Bob played the blue 2, but he must have been able to figure it out somehow.
  * Furthermore, Cathy knows that Alice's clue to Donald must be a *Finesse*, so Cathy must have the red 2 on her *Finesse Position*. She plays it, and it is instead the blue 5 and misplays.
  * This was Alice's fault, because *Bluffs* are only allowed if they can be revealed immediately from a blind-play.

### Self-Bluffs with Color Clues (Illegal)

* It is possible (and fairly common) to perform a *Self-Bluff* on a player with a rank clue.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 4 to Bob, which touches one brand new 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob knows that this is probably red 4, but he does not see any red 3's. Thus, Bob knows he must have the red 3, and blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is blue 1.
  * Bob now knows that he was *Bluffed* and that the 4 in his hand is exactly red 4.
* *Self-Bluffs* on players with color clues are nonsensical, so players should not have to entertain that possibility.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Red 2 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Bob, touching one brand new red card  as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob has a negative 3 clue on his red card, so he knows it cannot be red 3.
  * Bob does not see any red cards in other player's hands.
  * Bob cannot have the red 3 in his *Finesse Position*, because that card has negative red.
  * Bob now needs to figure out what the clue means. When going through all of the possibilities, he can safely put aside the possibility of a *Self-Bluff with Color* / a *Known Self-Bluff*, because we agree that they are illegal. The clue must have some other meaning and Bob will defer to whatever the next-most-likely thing is.

### Stacked Bluffs (Illegal)

* It is possible to "stack" a second *Finesse* on top of a player who is already *Finessed*. This kind of thing is generally encouraged, since it has few downsides. (For more information, see the [Stacked Finesse](#the-stacked-finesse).)
* However, players should **never** stack a *Bluff* on top of a player who is *Finessed*. This is because the blind-playing player will assume that a *Layered Finesse* is occurring and go on to play the card from the first *Finesse*. This means that the *Bluff* will not be resolved immediately, violating *Good Lie Principle*. (*Good Lie Principle* is one of the most important principles!) Typically, when this mistake happens, the team will go on to lose the game, because severe *Information Desynchronization* will occur.
* Sometimes, in rare circumstances, expert players can perform *Out-of-Position Bluffs*. (This is normally illegal, so it to work, it has to be a very specific situation.) When this occurs, it is illegal to stack a second *Bluff* on top of them. You cannot stack a *Bluff* on a *Bluff* for the same reason that you cannot stack a *Bluff* on a *Finesse* - the lie will not be resolved immediately and will violate *Good Lie Principle*.
  * Similarly, it is illegal to stack an *Ejection* or a *Discharge* on a *Bluff*. (*Ejections* and *Discharges* are advanced moves that are covered later.)

<br />

## Level 9 - Fellow

* Level 9 strategies should only be learned if you have 140+ games of experience with the group.
* This level introduces 3 Bluffs and some higher level concepts.
* See the [learning path document](Learning_Path.md) for general descriptions of each level.

<br />

### Duplication Responsibility

* Usually, if a 2 needs to be saved, it is not the responsibility of a player with already-clued 2's in his hand, because they could potentially violate *Good Touch Principle* by cluing it, so they should defer and let someone else on the team do it. (The same general concept also applies to cluing playable cards on chop, for example.)
* However, if all players have a clued 2 in their hand, then someone has to take a risk of violating *Good Touch Principle* in order to satisfy *Save Principle*. Who should do it?
* In this situation, the player who has the least number of matching clued cards should take responsibility. If 2+ players are tied, then the player with the less specific type of clue on their card(s) should take responsibility.
* If 2+ players have the exact same number of clued cards and type of clued cards, then either player should save the card.
* Example 1:
  * In a 3 player game, Alice has a blue 2 on chop that needs to be saved.
  * Bob has 2 unknown 2's.
  * Cathy has 1 unknown 2.
  * Bob should let Cathy perform the save, since 1 matching card is less than 2 matching cards.
* Example 2:
  * In a 3 player game, Alice has a blue 2 on chop that needs to be saved.
  * Bob has 2 unknown 2's.
  * Cathy has 2 unknown 2's.
  * The responsibility is shared, so Bob should perform the clue if Cathy has a good discard, or he can discard and let Cathy do it.
* Example 3:
  * In a 3 player game, Alice has a blue 2 on chop that needs to be saved.
  * Bob has 2 unknown blue cards.
  * Cathy has 1 unknown 2's.
  * Bob should let Cathy perform the save, since 1 matching card is less than 2 matching cards.
* Example 4:
  * In a 3 player game, Alice has a blue 2 on chop that needs to be saved.
  * Bob has 2 unknown blue cards. No blue cards have been played yet, so from Bob's perspective, each blue card has a 1/5 chance of being the blue 2.
  * Cathy has 2 unknown 2's. No 2's have been played yet, so from Cathy's perspective, each 2 has a 1/5 chance of being the blue 2.
  * The responsibility is shared, so Bob should perform the clue if Cathy has a good discard, or he can discard and let Cathy do it.
* Example 5:
  * In a 3 player game, Alice has a blue 2 on chop that needs to be saved.
  * Bob has 2 unknown blue cards. No blue cards have been played yet, so from Bob's perspective, each blue card has a 1/5 chance of being the blue 2.
  * Cathy has 2 unknown 2's. One 2 has been played already, so from Cathy's perspective, each 2 has a 1/4 chance of being the blue 2.
  * Thus, it is Bob's responsibility to save the blue 2.

### The Ambiguous Finesse

* Sometimes, the player that is supposed to blind-play a card into a *Finesse* is ambiguous. For example, in a 4-player game:
  * Nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Donald about a red 2 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Both Bob **and** Cathy have red 1 on their *Finesse Position*.
  * Bob will think that it is a *Finesse* directed at Cathy, and he will discard.
  * Next, Cathy thinks that Bob made a mistake and "missed" the *Finesse*. Cathy discards.
* Here, Cathy is actually the one making the mistake. It follows from *High-Value Principle* that you should never assume that your teammates are making a mistake. If Bob is discarding, then it means that Cathy also has the exact same copy of the card, and Cathy should immediately blind-play.

### The Ambiguous Finesse Pass-Back

* When an *Ambiguous Finesse* occurs, one person will hesitate, not playing into the *Finesse*. Once that happens, it is usually clear that someone else on the team also has the matching card. Next, the other person should **immediately blind-play**, resolving the *Ambiguous Finesse* as fast as possible.
* However, in some specific situations, the next person **cannot** blind-play the card, or else a misplay would occur. In these situations, the second person has to **also** hesitate, "passing" the blind-play back to the first person again.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * Blue 1 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues blue to Donald, touching a blue 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob sees that Cathy has the blue 2 on her *Finesse Position*. From his position, this must be a *Double Finesse*, with Cathy blind-playing the blue 2, and Bob blind-playing the blue 3 from his own *Finesse Position*. Bob discards.
  * Cathy sees that Bob has the blue 2 on his *Finesse Position* and the blue 3 on his *Second Finesse Position*.
  * Cathy also knows that the only reason that Bob would discard is if Cathy **also** had the blue 2 on her *Finesse Position*. Thus, Bob expects her to blind-play on this turn, and this is an *Ambiguous Finesse*.
  * Normally, Cathy would blind-play the blue 2 herself. However, in this situation, if she blind-plays the blue 2, then Bob would go on to misplay the other blue 2, thinking that it is blue 3.
  * Thus, Cathy must pretend like the *Finesse* is not on her after all, and force Bob to be the one to blind-play first. Cathy discards her chop card, passing the *Finesse* back to Bob.
  * Donald and Alice discard.
  * Bob knows that Cathy was supposed to blind-play the blue 2, but she didn't. He must also have the blue 2. Furthermore, he must also have the blue 3, as that would be an excellent reason for Cathy to pass the *Finesse* back to him. Bob will now blind-play blue 2 and blue 3.
* As a side note, you may be wondering why, in the above example, Cathy does not blind-discard her blue 2 from her *Finesse Position* instead of discarding her chop. This is because it is possible that Cathy does **not** have the blue 2 on her *Finesse Position* and instead has some other unrelated playable card as a *Layered Finesse*. Thus, Cathy must play it safe and discard her chop. (The *[Layered Finesse](#the-layered-finesse)* is a move covered in Level 4.)

### The Trash Order Chop Move

* Sometimes, a player will have two known trash cards in their hand (and these cards are explicitly known trash, meaning that everyone on the team can equally see that they are known trash).
* In this situation, the player is expected to discard the newest (left-most) trash card.
* Thus, if a player skips over their newest trash card and instead discards the second newest trash card, they must be trying to communicate something extra.
* This means that the next player should *Chop Move* (in a manner similar to a *Order Chop Move*).
* Note that a player is not necessarily trying to perform a *Trash Order Chop Move* if the two trash cards have different kinds of clues on them. For example, by discarding specific trash cards, it can communicate that the player "sees" all of the non-trash possibilities of that card.

### The 3 Bluff

* Typically, the player who receives a clue that causes a *Bluff* blind-play knows that the card that was clued is one-away from being playable.
* Our group plays with an artificial *3 Bluffs* convention. This means that in addition to being one-away from being playable, we agree that the touched card can also be any 3 that will be useful in the future.
* Here are some examples that cover the four most common *3 Bluff* situations:
    * Example 1 - **Color mismatch (valid):**
      * On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Cathy red, which touches a red 3.
      * Bob blind-plays blue 1.
      * Cathy knows that it is either a red 2 (if it was a normal *Bluff*) or a red 3 (if it was a *3 Bluff*). She marks down both of the possibilities for later.
    * Example 2 - **Number 3 with suit mismatch (valid):**
      * On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Cathy number 3, which touches a red 3.
      * Bob blind-plays blue 1.
      * Cathy knows that it was a *3 Bluff*, because a played 1 does not "match" number 3.
      * Beyond that, Cathy knows nothing about the card, besides that it is a 3 (since it has a number 3 clue on it).
    * Example 3 - **Color match (NOT valid; looks like a Double Finesse):**
      * On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Cathy red, which touches a red 3.
      * Bob blind-plays red 1.
      * Cathy sees that Bob does not have red 2. Since red matches red, Cathy assumes that she has the red 2.
      * Cathy misplays red 3 as red 2.
      * Alternatively, if Cathy saw that Bob had both red 1 and red 2 on *Finesse Position* at the time the clue was given, she would know that she has the red 2 **or** the red 3. Subsequently, Bob is promised a red 2, since if he does not blind-play a card, Cathy will go on to misplay the red 3 as red 2.
    * Example 4 - **Number 3 with suit match (valid):**
      * On the first turn of the game, Alice clues Cathy number 3, which touches a red 3.
      * Bob blind-plays red 1.
      * Cathy knows that it was a *3 Bluff*, because a played 1 does not "match" number 3.
      * Beyond that, Cathy knows nothing about the card, besides that it is a 3 (since it has a number 3 clue on it).
      * Even though red 1 and red 3 are the same suit, Bob is not promised a red 2, because if he does nothing, Cathy will not go on to misplay the red 3.
* *3 Bluffs* can be confusing. If you don't want to memorize the four examples above, you can simply ask the following questions:
  1) Does the clue "match" the blind-play? If it matches, then it is a *Finesse*. If it does not match, then it is a *Bluff*. Red matches red, but red does **not** match blue. 2 matches 3, but 1 does **not** match 3.
  2) Will the player who received the clue go on to misplay if nothing else is blind-played? If yes, then it is a *Finesse*. If no, then it is a *Bluff*.

### The Critical 4 Bluff

* Building on the *3 Bluffs* convention, we also agree that it is possible for a card that initiates a *Bluff* to be a copy of any of the 4s that are currently in the discard pile, but only if **a color clue** is used.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Nothing is played on the stacks. Red 4 is currently in the discard pile.
  * Alice clues Cathy red, touching a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob blind-plays a blue 1.
  * Cathy marks her red card as the *one-away-from-playable* red card, the red 2.
  * However, Cathy also knows that *3 Bluffs* are a thing, so she *also* marks her red card as possibly a red 3.
  * However, Cathy also knows that *Critical 4 Bluffs* are a thing, so she *also* marks her red card as possibly a red 4.

### Legal Bluff Targets

* The full list of "legal *Bluff* targets" is as follows:
  * any *one-away-from-playable* card (with either a color clue or a number clue)
  * any 3 (with either a color clue or a number clue)
  * any critical 4 (only with a color clue)

### Context Clues & The Stale 1's Clue

* We have many conventions that specify what a clue means. But combined with this, we are always expected to look at the context of the game.
* For example, sometimes players will receive a clue that just feels strange. If this good clue could have been given a bunch of turns ago, why is it only being given now? Were the other players not paying close enough attention, and are only getting around to cluing this card now?
* In these types of situations, from *High Value Principle*, you can assume that the team is not making any mistakes, which means that the meaning of the clue should be altered from the "textbook" definition. We call these types of clues *Context Clues* because they rely on contextual reading of the game state.
* The most common *Context Clue* is given to "stale" 1's towards the beginning of the game. For example, in a 3-player game:
  * After a few ordinary clues happen, Alice discards, which ends the *Early Game* and initiates the *Mid-Game*. By doing this, she implies that there is nothing to do (because players are mandated to "extinguish" all of the available *Play Clues* and *Save Clues* in the *Early Game*).
  * Bob then immediately clues Cathy about two 1's.
  * Normally, from *Good Touch Principle*, Cathy would assume that both of the 1's were "good" and play both.
  * However, Cathy also knows that if both of these 1's were good, then Alice was required to clue them before discarding.
  * Thus, Cathy can reason that one of the 1's are bad. Furthermore, by convention, she knows that the oldest (right-most) 1 is bad, because that would be the one that she would ordinarily play first.
  * So, Cathy should skip over the oldest (right-most) 1, and play the other 1. Cathy should also treat the other 1 as known-trash.
* The *Stale 1's Clue* is specific example of a more general concept called *Focus Inversion*, which is covered later.

### Focus Inversion

* Sometimes, a *Play Clue* is given that both touches the chop card and one or more other card. The normal interpretation of this is to treat it as a chop-focus *Play Clue*, and play the chop. However, sometimes a player can know that the chop is not actually playable. This can be determined through:
  * explicit information - negative clues present on the card
  * implicit information - historical / contextual information about the card derived from moves that teammates performed earlier on in the game
* When this occurs, the clue is meant to be a *Play Clue* on the left-most card **instead** of the chop card.
* Just like a "normal" *Play Clue* that touches multiple new cards, the chop card (and other new cards introduced) are not necessarily playable right now.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Alice clues 1's to Bob, which introduces one card on slot 1.
  * Bob plays the 1 and it is red 1.
  * Cathy clues blue to Bob, which introduces two cards on slot 1 and slot 5.
  * Normally, Bob would think that this is a *Chop-Focus* clue, and play the blue 1 from slot 5.
  * However, his slot 5 card has a negative 1 clue on it (from Alice's number 1 clue), so it explicitly cannot be the blue 1.
  * Thus, this must be *Focus Inversion* and blue 1 must be on slot 1. The blue card on slot 5 can be either blue 2, blue 3, blue 4, or blue 5.
* Note that ***Self-Finesses* with rank always take precedence over *Focus Inversion***. (*Self-Finesses* with rank are quite common, but a *Self Finesses* with color are nonsensical.)

### The Positional Discard (Indicating a Play with a Discard)

* Near the end of the game, if you have no clues left and no cards to play, you can transmit information based on which card you discard.
* Thus, you can discard the slot in your hand that matches the slot in someone else's hand that they are supposed to play.
* Usually, players will only do this if they can see all of the remaining useful cards. Since they see everything, they know that they cannot be discarding anything important.

### The Positional Misplay (Indicating a Play with a Misplay)

* On the final round of the game, if a player has no cards in their hand to play, a *Positional Discard* from **any** slot will work, because it is globally known that every card is visible.
* However, sometimes *Positional Discards* are done before the final round while there are still some cards left in the deck. In this situation, if a player discarded their chop card as a *Positional Discard*, this would not work, because discarding chop is the normal action that the rest of the team is expecting.
* Thus, in order to more strongly communicate the "play this slot" message, they can instead misplay their chop card. Since the rest of the team can see that the card misplayed for "no reason", they can deduce that it was a *Positional Misplay*.

### The Double Positional Misplay (Indicating Two Plays with a Misplay)

* Normally, the *Positional Misplay* is only used as a last-resort when a *Positional Discard* would not work. But what if a player does a *Positional Misplay* when a normal *Positional Discard* would have gotten the job done?
* *Positional Discards* and *Positional Misplays* promise that only one card in the specified slot is playable. So, if there are **two** people with a play on the same slot, then it will be ambiguous, because each of them will think that the other person is supposed to play.
* Thus, a *Positional Misplay* that is unnecessary transforms into a *Double Positional Misplay*, indicating to the team that **two** cards on that exact slot are playable.

## Level 10 - Journeyman

* Level 10 strategies should only be learned if you have 160+ games of experience with the group.
* This level introduces the concept of Priority and all of the complicated stipulations that go along with it.
* See the [learning path document](Learning_Path.md) for general descriptions of each level.

<br />

### The Priority Prompt & The Priority Finesse

* Typically, players will only have one card to play at a time. In this case, unless there is some really good clue to give, there are no decisions to be made - they just play their one playable card.
* What if a player has two or more playable cards to play? Which card should they play first?
* If one of the cards is not completely known yet (e.g. a playable 2 of unknown color), then the player might want to play that card first in order to find out exactly what it is. In general, **nothing special is triggered by players playing an unknown card.**
* On the other hand, something special **can** be triggered if a player plays a fully-known card, because they knew exactly what they were doing. Our group agrees that **playable cards should be played in a specific order**. We refer to this as *Priority*. The agreed *Priority* is as follows:

| Priority | Category of card                                                   | Reason
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------
| 1        | Blind-plays                                                        | Demonstrating that a *Finesse* or *Bluff* occurred is very important.
| 2        | Cards that lead into clued cards in someone else's hand            | Otherwise, the team would lose *Tempo*.
| 3        | Cards that lead into the player's own hand                         | It is bad for a suit to be "held up" on one player.
| 4        | 5's                                                                | Playing a 5 gets the team a free clue.
| 5        | The lower rank card                                                | The smaller stacks are more important to fill up.
| 6        | The left-most card                                                 | The left-most card is more likely to be good.

* If someone plays a fully-known card and the card does **not** have *Priority*, then the player must be trying to send a special message.
* Based on what card they did play, if you have any clued cards in your hand that match the next "connecting" card, it is a message that you can play it right now as a *Priority Prompt*. (This is similar to a normal *Prompt*, except instead of initiating the *Prompt* with a clue, they initiated it with the order that they played cards.)
* Alternatively, if you do not have any clued cards in your hand that matches the card that they played, then you should play your *Finesse Position* card as a *Priority Finesse*.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Alice has a clued + known playable red 1 and a clued + known playable blue 2 in her hand.
  * Alice plays blue 2.
  * Bob comes next. Bob knows that normally, when you have a choice between two cards, you are supposed to play the lowest rank card. (Unless it is a blind-play, or it leads into someone's hand, or it is a 5.) Bob does not see any blue 3's, so he knows that Alice was supposed to play the red 1 instead of the blue 2. Alice **did not** play the card with *Priority*.
  * This means that Bob must have a blue 3. Bob does not have any clued cards in his hand, so he blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card.
* Similar to a normal *Prompt*, if a *Priority Prompt* could apply to two or more clued cards, then you should play the left-most one.
* Similar to a normal *Prompt*, if a *Priority Prompt* made you play the left-most card and it was not the matching card, then you should continuing playing clued cards until you find the matching card.

### The Priority Bluff

* Similar to a normal *Bluff*, it is also possible for players to perform a *Priority Bluff*.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Alice has a known playable red 1 and a known playable blue 2 in her hand.
  * Alice plays blue 2.
  * Bob comes next. Bob knows that normally, when you have a choice between two cards, you are supposed to play the lowest rank card. (Unless it is a blind-play, or it leads into someone's hand, or it is a 5.) Bob does not see any blue 3's, so he knows that Alice was supposed to play the red 1 instead of the blue 2. Alice **did not** play the card with *Priority*.
  * This means that Bob must have a blue 3. Bob does not have any clued cards in his hand, so he blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is **not** the blue 3 and is instead the green 1. Bob now knows that he was *Bluffed* and that no-one has the blue 3.

### A Priority Flowchart (For Choosing Between 2+ Playable Cards)

*Priority* can be confusing. [Here is a flowchart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/master/img/flowcharts/priority_flowchart.png) that shows, in general, which card should be played when there is a choice between two cards.

[Here is another flowchart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/master/img/flowcharts/priority_unknown_flowchart.png) that shows how *Priority* works when one or more of the cards is unknown.

### Priority Exceptions

Priority does not always apply. Some common exceptions are listed below.

#### 1) *End-Game*

* *Priority* is generally "turned off" in the *End-Game*, because players often need to play specific cards.
* With that said, *Priority* can still work if a player plays a card that would be really terrible for the team otherwise.

#### 2) The 4's Priority Exception

* If a player has a known playable 5 and a known playable 4 that leads into their own hand, then according to the above *Priority* table, the known playable 4 would have *Priority*. However, this does not make much sense, since the 5 has to be played no matter what, playing the 5 gives the team a clue back, the 4 could be played by someone else, and so on.
* Thus, if a player has a known playable 5 and a known playable 4 that leads into their own hand, then the 5 is said to have *Priority*.

#### 3) Blind-Playing Globally-Known Cards

* Normally, blind-playing cards has *Priority* over everything else.
* However, in some advanced cases, the blind-play does not need to be demonstrated to the team - everyone already has full knowledge of what is going on. In this case, players are supposed to treat the cards as clued for the purposes of finding the *Priority*. (The *Gentleman's Discards* is the main move that this applies to.)

#### 4) "Important" Cards

* Normally, cards that are the same rank should be played from left-to-right.
* However, in certain situations, players can know that some **other** card is **more important** than the left-most card. If a player plays a "more important" card, it should never trigger a "right-to-left" style *Priority Finesse*.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * In the *Early Game*, Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching three 2's on slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5 (his chop). (This is the *2 Save* convention.)
  * Later on in the game, all of the 1's are now played on the stacks.
  * Bob has not received any other clues since then - all of his 2's are known playable, but he has no idea what color they are.
  * Normally, Bob knows that he is supposed to play his 2's from left-to-right. However, he also knows that his 2 on slot 5 is the most important card out of all of them - it was the focus of the original *2 Save* by Alice.
  * Thus, Bob plays his 2 on slot 5 first. After that, he plays the 2's from left-to-right like normal.

### The Load Clue

* Players will generally play cards without *Priority* if they see the next card in someone else's *Finesse Position*, because this will get the card for "free" as a *Priority Finesse*.
* Less commonly, players will see the next card in someone else's hand, but it will not be in *Finesse Position*. In these cases, it might still be good to play the card without *Priority*, just so that the player with the next card will have something to do on their turn.
* However, if they do play the card without *Priority*, it will cause an impending misplay because the target player will think the card is actually on their *Finesse Position*. Thus, doing this **forces** someone to give a clue to the card directly in order to stop the misplay.
* This clue is similar to a *Fix Clue*, since it fixes an impending misplay. But we specifically call this kind of clue a *Load Clue* to differentiate it from a *Fix Clue* that fixes a lie or mistake. It is a *Load Clue* because it is loading the player up with something to do on their turn.
* If you receive a *Load Clue*, you should suspect that you might have something valuable on your chop, as this would be an excellent reason to commit the team to giving the *Load Clue* in the first place.
* If a player has a choice between playing one card that leads nowhere and playing one card that commits the team to giving a *Load Clue*, then they are not obligated to choose one or the other - they can choose whichever one is best for the situation.
* When a player receives a *Load Clue*, they are to interpret it as a normal *Play Clue* instead of a *Fix Clue*. For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Blue 1 and red 1 are played on the stacks.
  * Alice has a choice between playing a known blue 2 and a known red 2. The blue 2 has *Priority* because it is the left-most card.
  * Alice plays the red 2.
  * Bob sees that Cathy has the red 3, but it is on her chop instead of on her *Finesse Position*. Thus, Bob must now give a *Load Clue* to stop the impending misplay.
  * Cathy's hand is, from newest to oldest: yellow 4, yellow 3, yellow 4, blue 1, red 3.
  * Bob clues number 3 to Cathy.
  * Cathy is surprised - she was about to play her *Finesse Position* card as red 3, but she now knows that it can't be a red 3.
  * If this was a *Fix Clue*, Cathy might be inclined to play the card that was closest to her slot 1 (which would be the 3 on slot 2).
  * However, Cathy knows that *Load Clues* are to be interpreted as normal *Play Clues* instead of *Fix Clues*, so she interprets this as a normal *Chop-Focus Play Clue* and plays red 3 from slot 5.

### The Priority Finesse (Special Case)

* To review, if a player has two playable cards, and both of them are fully-known, then they always have the ability to trigger a *Priority Finesse*.
* If a player has two playable cards, and only one of them is fully-known, a *Priority Finesse* will never be triggered if they play the unknown card.
* But what if a player plays a fully-known card over an unknown card? They **can still** trigger a *Priority Finesse*, but **only** if every single possibility for the unknown card would have *Priority* over the card that was played.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Red 2 is played on the stacks. The 1's are played on all of the other stacks.
  * Alice has a globally-known red 3. (She was given a *Play Clue* on it earlier.)
  * Alice has a 2 of unknown color. (She was given a *Save Clue* on it earlier, but it is now playable since all of the 1's are down.)
  * Alice's 2 could be either blue 2, green 2, yellow 2, or purple 2.
  * The rest of the team does not have any clued cards in their hands.
  * Alice knows that **all** of the possibilities for the 2 would have *Priority* over the red 3, since all of them are lower rank.
  * Alice plays the red 3 anyway, which triggers a *Priority Finesse* on the red 4.

### The Trust Finesse (A Situational Priority Finesse)

* According to the *Priority* rules, if an unknown card is played, no *Priority Finesse* can be triggered.
* However, even if this is the case, if playing one of the cards over the other would be really dumb, it should still trigger a *Finesse*.
* This type of move is called a *Trust Finesse* to distinguish it from the case where the card is globally known.
* It is also possible to perform a *Trust Prompt*, a *Trust Bluff*, and so forth.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice has two playable cards in her hand:
    * One of the cards has a red clue on it. Since it was originally clued as a *Play Clue*, it is globally known that Alice knows that this is exactly red 2.
    * One of the cards has a number 2 clue on it. Since it was originally clued with a *Save Clue*, it can be any non-red 2. But it is playable because all of the 1's are already played.
  * Bob has a clued and globally known red 3 in his hand.
  * Alice knows that she is expected to play her red 2 into Bob's red 3, because that would be good teamwork.
  * Unknown from the rest of the team, Alice knows from the context of the game that her 2 must be exactly blue 2.
  * Bob has blue 3 on his *Finesse Position*.
  * Alice plays the globally unknown 2 to cause a *Trust Finesse*.

### The Paused Priority Finesse

* For the purposes of *Priority*, blind-playing a card is the most important thing to do. When players are supposed to be blind-playing a card, they are usually **not** allowed to perform a *Priority Finesse* - they must stick to playing the blind card.
* One exception to this is if a player is in the middle of unraveling the layer of a *Layered Finesse*. Since they have already blind-played their first card in the layer, they have demonstrated that the *Finesse* was on them, and now everyone on the team knows that the rest of the cards inside of the layer are "gotten" for sure.
* Note that this only applies when the card that was blind-played was unrelated to the original *Layered Finesse*. 
  * For example, if a player is finessed for both the red 1 and the red 2 and has just blind-played a green 1, then they can perform a *Paused Priority Finesse*, because everyone on the team knows that the green 1 played as red 1 and therefore that the layer is not yet unraveled.
  * However, if a player is finessed for both the red 1 and the red 2 and has just blind-played the red 1, then they **cannot** perform a *Paused Priority Finesse* because even they have not yet demonstrated to the team that they are still finessed for the red 2.
* Thus, in this situation, a player can "pause" finishing up the *Layered Finesse* and play some other clued card to perform a *Paused Priority Finesse*.

## Level 11 - Advanced

* Level 11 strategies should only be learned if you have 180+ games of experience with the group.
* This level introduces Elimination and all of the complicated situations that go along with it.
* See the [learning path document](Learning_Path.md) for general descriptions of each level.

<br />

### Discard Elimination & Elimination Notes

* Normally, your teammates would never let you discard anything important. So when you discard some playable card (or a needed 2) **and** that card is not in anyone else's hand, you might think that the team make a mistake.
* From *High Value Principle*, you should never assume your teammates are making a mistake. One excellent reason that they would let you discard an important card is that you have the other copy in your hand. (In order to satisfy *Good Touch Principle*, they had to wait for you to discard it so that they would not duplicate the card.)
* Thus, when you get a follow-up clue, you will know exactly what card it is.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * Red 3 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice has a completely unclued hand.
  * Alice discards her chop (slot 5). It is a (playable) red 4.
  * Alice gasps in surprise - she knows that everyone on the team agrees to not let each other discard playable cards (*Save Principle*).
  * Alice knows that the team was not in a dire situation or anything, so the only explanation is that she must have the other copy of the red 4.
  * Alice writes a note of "r4?" on slots 2, 3, 4, and 5. (It can't be on slot 1, since that is the card she just drew.)
  * Bob clues Alice red, which touches a card on slot 1 and slot 2.
  * Normally, Alice would play the left-most card (slot 1) as the red 4. However, because of her notes, she knows that the red 4 must actually be on slot 2.
  * Alice successfully plays red 4 from slot 2. Since the red 5 is the only good red card left, Alice can assume that her other red card is red 5 (from *Good Touch Principle*), and she can play it on the next turn.
* In this example, the "r4?" notes that Alice writes are called *Elimination Notes*. *Elimination Notes* are notes that represent the possible slots for a specific card.
* In this example, thing "thing" that triggered the writing of *Elimination Notes* was the discarding of a card, so this is called *Discard Elimination*.
* Note that players should not always make *Elimination Notes* when they discard a playable card. In some cases, games can be extremely busy, leaving no reasonable way to get the playable card. Players must just their best judgment and account for this.

### The Elimination Blind-Play

* First, see the section on [Discard Elimination](#discard-elimination--elimination-notes).
* In the example for *Discard Elimination*, the team clued the second copy of the red 4 directly. But in other situations, the team will **not** need to clue anything. The player with the *Elimination Notes* can eliminate the possibilities one by one. When there is only one possibility left, they can blind-play the card as an *Elimination Blind-Play*.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * Red 3 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice has a completely unclued hand.
  * Alice discards her chop (slot 5). It is a (playable) red 4.
  * Alice knows that the team was not in a dire situation or anything, so the only explanation is that she must have the other copy of the red 4.
  * Alice writes "r4?" *Elimination Notes* on slots 2, 3, 4, and 5. (It can't be on slot 1, since that is the card she just drew.)
  * Bob clues Alice blue, which touches slots 1, 2, 3, and 4. (This is a *Play Clue* on slot 1.)
  * Alice writes a note of "blue 1" on slot 1.
  * Alice erases her *Elimination Notes* for the red 4 from slots 2, 3, and 4.
  * The only card left with an *Elimination Note* is slot 5.
  * Alice can now blind-play the red 4 when it gets to her turn as an *Elimination Blind-Play*.

### The Elimination Play Clue

* A clue that touches multiple cards only has one focus. As you probably know, if the chop card was not touched, then the focus is the left-most card.
* However, this rule does not apply if a clue singles out a playable card from *Elimination*. In this case, the card is only focused on the *Elimination* card, and any other cards touched are not necessarily playable right now.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Red 1 and blue 1 are played on the stacks.
  * Alice has both red 2's in her hand on slot 3 and slot 5. (Alice's chop is her slot 5.)
  * Alice discards her chop, and it is revealed to be the red 2.
  * Alice is surprised, and writes *Discard Elimination Notes* for red 2 on slots 2, 3, 4, and 5.
  * Bob gives a number 2 clue to Alice that touches a card in slot 1 and slot 4.
  * Normally, Alice would treat this as a *Play Clue* on the 2 in her slot 1. However, she now knows that her slot 4 card is exactly red 2 (and that she can play it right now).
  * Thus, Alice knows that the point of the clue was only to get the red 2. The 2 in her slot 1 can be any 2 in the game and is not necessarily playable right now.

### The Elimination Riding Deduction

* If:
  * there are only two cards left in a player's hand with *Elimination Notes* **and**
  * the previous players let the chop card ride **and**
  * the previous players were not busy, **then**
* The card with the *Elimination Note* card cannot be on the chop! (Otherwise, one of the previous players would have clued it with either a *Play Clue* or a *Save Clue* in order to prevent it from being discarded.)
* In such a situation, the player with the *Elimination Notes* can "jump ahead" and immediately blind-play the newest of the two cards.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Red 1 has been played on the red stack.
  * Alice has a completely unclued hand.
  * Alice discards her chop (slot 5). It is a (playable) red 2.
  * Alice knows that the team was not busy, so she must have the other copy of red 2.
  * Alice writes *Elimination Notes* on slots 2, 3, 4, and 5.
  * Alice receives no clues on the next go-around of the table. She discards, and now has *Elimination Notes* on slots 3, 4, and 5.
  * Alice receives no clues on the next go-around of the table. She discards, and now has *Elimination Notes* on slots 4 and 5.
  * Alice receives no clues on the next go-around of the table. Her teammates would not let the other copy of red 2 be discarded, so it must be on slot 4. Alice blind-plays red 2 from slot 4.

### The Elimination Riding Deduction Bluff

* Typically, when a player has two cards with *Elimination Notes* and the "true" copy of the card is on chop, you must clue it to let them know.
* However, if the other card is also playable, you can "lie" to them and not clue anything.
* Next, the player should perform an *Elimination Riding Deduction*, and play the unrelated card.
* After that, there will be only one card left with an *Elimination Note*, so they will go on to play the "true" card on their next turn.

### The Elimination Self-Chop Move

* Sometimes, you will have narrowed down your *Elimination Notes* to one specific card. Thus, even though the card has no positive clues on it, you know the exact identity of the card.
* If the card in question is on your chop **and** the card is not yet playable **and** you need to discard, you should obviously not discard the important elimination card. You should instead self-chop move and discard the next thing.

### Double Discard Elimination

* When a player who is in a *Double Discard* situation discards anyway with an obvious clue to give (such as a *5 Stall* on an off-chop 5), it implies that they **see** the other copy of the card, and were not *Double Discarding* at all.
* Thus, when this occurs, you should write *Elimination Notes* on your entire hand for that card.
* This is almost exactly the same thing as *Discard Elimination*, except it is triggered by the discard of a separate player.

### The Elimination Finesse

* Normally, if a player is *Finessed*, they are supposed to play their *Finesse Position* card. However, what if they have *Elimination Notes* on their hand for the specific card that is *Finessed*?
* In most situations, there will not be an *Elimination Note* on slot 1 (e.g. the *Finesse Position*). This means that playing slot 1 into the *Finesse* would not make any sense.
  * However, in the rare case where there is an *Elimination Note* on their *Finesse Position*, then the player should **still** not play the *Finesse Position*; read on.
* Here, the player is expected to play the **oldest** of the cards with the *Elimination Notes* on them (not counting *Chop Moved* cards, if any).
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Blue 2 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice has a completely unclued hand.
  * Alice discards a blue 3. Blue 3 was playable, and nothing urgent is currently happening, so she writes *Elimination Notes* on her hand for the other blue 3 on slots 2, 3, 4, and 5.
  * Bob clues Cathy blue, which touches a blue 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Cathy discards.
  * Alice knows that this is some sort of *Reverse Finesse*, as it is calling for the blue 3. However, the blue 3 cannot be in her *Finesse Position* (slot 1), as she knows from the *Elimination Notes* that it must be either on slot 2, 3, 4, or 5. So it must instead be a *Reverse Elimination Finesse*.
  * The *Elimination Finesse* promises that it is her oldest card, so she plays slot 5 as blue 3.
* As mentioned above, *Chop Moved* cards should be skipped over when finding the *Elimination Finesse* target. If there are two or more cards with *Elimination Notes* on them and they are all *Chop Moved*, then the oldest *Chop Moved* card should be played.
* *Elimination Finesses* apply to **all** types of situations with *Elimination Notes* (including *Double Discard Elimination Notes*). Subsequently, you can more specifically describe an *Elimination Finesse* as a *Discard Elimination Finesse* or a *Double Discard Elimination Finesse*.
* Note that normal *Finesses* take priority over *Self-Elimination Finesses*. For example, in a 3-player game:
  * On the stacks, red 2 and blue 2 are played.
  * Alice's hand is completely unclued. Alice has *Elimination Notes* on slot 3 and slot 4 for red 3.
  * Cathy clues a number 4 in Alice's slot 1 as a *Self-Finesse*.
  * If Alice's 4 is a blue 4, then this would be a normal *Self-Finesse*, and Alice should blind-play blue 3 from slot 2.
  * If Alice's 4 is a red 4, then this would be an *Elimination Self-Finesse*, and Alice should blind-play red 3 from slot 4.
  * Alice knows that in this situation, you always supposed to assume a normal *Finesse*, so she blind-plays blue 3 from slot 2.

## Level 12 - Adept

* Level 12 strategies should only be learned if you have 200+ games of experience with the group.
* This level introduces *Ejections*.
* See the [learning path document](Learning_Path.md) for general descriptions of each level.

<br />

## Ejection

* *Ejection* refers to a move like a *Bluff*, but instead of playing an unrelated card from *Finesse Position*, someone plays an unrelated card from their *Second Finesse Position*. For example, if a player's hand is completely unclued, their *Second Finesse Position* is slot 2.
* Just like a *Bluff*, an *Ejection* can only be performed on the very next player.
* Several different kinds of moves can cause an *Ejection*. The most common one is called the *5 Color Ejection*.

### The 5 Color Ejection (5CE)

* Normally, if a player gives a color *Play Clue* to a 5, it would mean that it is a *Finesse* on the 5 and all of the cards leading up to the 5 are playable.
* If the very next player sees that they will only have to **blind-play one card** in their hand to fulfill the *Finesse*, then they should assume that it is a *Finesse* and blind-play their *Finesse Position*.
* If the very next player sees that they would have to **blind-play two or more cards** in their hand to fulfill the *Finesse*, then a *Finesse* is unlikely. Instead, players agree that this signals an *Ejection* and that the next player should play their *Second Finesse Position*.
  * *Prompts* don't factor into the "two or more blind-plays" rule. Players only count the number of blind-plays.
* After the blind-play, the player who received the clue will know that they must have a 5.
* Note that *5 Color Ejection* only applies if the 5 did not have any clues on it already. If a 5 is re-clued, it signals a *Finesse* on all of the cards leading up to the 5.
  * However, the "invisible" clue from a *Chop Move* does not count. In other words, you **can** perform a *5 Color Ejection* with a *Chop Moved* 5, as long as the card does not have any positive clues on it.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 5 on slot 3.
  * Bob knows that normally, this would be a *Finesse* on the 5, indicating to Bob that he has the red 1, the red 2, the red 3, and the red 4. However, since this calls for more than one blind card, he knows that *5 Color Ejection* should take precedence, so he knows to play his *Second Finesse Position* card. It is a red 1 and it successfully plays.
  * From Cathy's perspective, if Bob had played his *Finesse Position* card in response to the red clue, then Cathy would know that it was a *Finesse* or a *Bluff*. But since Bob blind-played his *Second Finesse Position* card, it must be a *5 Color Ejection*. Cathy marks the red card as red 5.
* In the previous example, a *5 Color Ejection* was preformed with the 5 being the only brand new card introduced with the color clue. However, it is also possible to perform a *5 Color Ejection* with more than one card introduced. Normally, this kind of thing would signal an *Out-of-Order Finesse*, but the *5 Color Ejection* interpretation should take precedence as long as the next player would have to blind-play two or more cards.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 5 on slot 2 and a red 2 on slot 3.
  * Bob knows that normally, this would be an *Out-of-Order Finesse* on the 5, indicating to Bob that he has the red 1, the red 3, and the red 4. However, since this calls for more than one blind card, he knows that *5 Color Ejection* should take precedence, so he knows to play his *Second Finesse Position* card. It is a red 1 and it successfully plays.
  * From Cathy's perspective, if Bob had played his *Finesse Position* card in response to the red clue, then Cathy would know that it was a *Finesse* or a *Bluff*. But since Bob blind-played his *Second Finesse Position* card, it must be a *5 Color Ejection*. Cathy marks the red card as red 5. Her other red card can be red 2, red 3, or red 4.

## Level 13 - Senior

* Level 13 strategies should only be learned if you have 220+ games of experience with the group.
* This level introduces the "early" 5 moves.
* See the [learning path document](Learning_Path.md) for general descriptions of each level.

<br />

### The Early 5's Chop Move

* In the *Early Game*, players are only allowed to clue an off-chop 5 if there is nothing left to do. (Or, as a special exception, if there is only one *Play Clue* to give to a card that happens to be on *Finesse Position*.)
* Thus, if someone clues a 5 and there **is** something else to do, they are performing a special move.
* If the 5 is one-away from chop, then they are performing an *Early 5's Chop Move*. This functions in the exact same way a normal *5's Chop Move* does (except it was done in the *Early Game*, which is not normally possible).

### The 5 Pull

* This convention only applies in the *Early Game*.
* In the *Early Game*, players are only allowed to clue an off-chop 5 if there is nothing left to do. (Or, as a special exception, if there is only one *Play Clue* to give to a card that happens to be on *Finesse Position*.)
* Thus, if someone clues a 5 and there **is** something else to do, they are performing a special move.
* If the 5 is two or more away from chop, then they are performing a *5 Pull*. A *5 Pull* causes the player to blind-play the card to the right of the 5. For the player receiving the clue, it is understood that the 5 is not actually related to the blind-play. This is why it is called a *Pull* instead of a *Finesse* or a *Bluff*.
* *5 Pulls* are typically done to 5's that are in slot 1. But, for example, you can also clue a 5 in slot 2 in order to get a blind-play on slot 3.
* Even though they involve playing a blind card, a *5 Pull* should be treated as a *Delayed Play Clue*. This means that the blind card could play through any existing touched cards.
* *5 Pulls* also take precedence over *Finesses* and *Bluffs*. For example:
  * It is the *Early Game*.
  * Red 3 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Cathy number 5, touching a red 5 on slot 1. (There are other *Play Clues* for Alice to give, so this is **not** a *5 Stall*.)
  * Normally, Bob would think that this is a *Finesse* and that he should blind-play his *Finesse Position* card as the red 4.
  * However, *5 Pulls* take precedence over *Finesses*. Bob can see that there is a playable blue 1 to the right of the 5, so no-one is promised the red 4.
* Since *5 Pulls* take precedence over *Finesses*, it is even possible to *5 Pull* a 4 without promising that the 5 is the matching suit.
* When a player is *Finessed* or *Bluffed*, they are allowed to defer playing the blind card in order to do a *Finesse* or *Bluff* of their own. However, if they could be *Bluffed*, they are **not** allowed to initiate a *5 Pull*. (Players are still allowed to defer playing into a *Finesse* in order to initiate a *5 Pull*.)
* In the rare case where a *5 Pull* is performed in a 3-player game by touching two 5's in slot 1 and slot 3, then the *5 Pulled* card is slot 2.
* For expert players, we define a specific [interaction between *5's Chop Moves* / *5 Pulls* and *2 Saves*](#2-saves-advanced-section-interaction-with-5s-chop-moves--5-pulls).

### A Flowchart for Cluing 5's in the Early Game

* Differentiating between a *5 Stall* and a *5 Pull* can sometimes be confusing. [Here is a handy flowchart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/master/img/flowcharts/early_game_5_flowchart.png) that steps you through how you can tell the difference.

### The 5 Pull Prompt & The 5 Pull Finesse

* *5 Pulls* are also allowed to initiate a *Prompt* or *Finesse*.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Cathy's hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: `blue 4, blue 4, blue 5, red 2, blue 2`
  * Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, touching the blue 5 on slot 3.
  * Bob knows that since the team is the *Early Game*, Alice's clue might be a *5 Stall*. However, Bob also knows that you are only allowed to perform a *5 Stall* if there are no normal *Save Clues* or *Play Clues* to give. Bob sees that Cathy has a blue 2 on chop that could have been saved with a *2 Save*. Thus, Bob knows that Alice's clue cannot not be a *5 Stall*, which makes it a *5 Pull* instead (since it is two-or-more-away from the chop).
  * Bob knows that if this was a *5 Pull*, it would be pulling the red 2. If Bob does nothing, Cathy might go on to misplay the red 2 as some playable 1.
  * Thus, this must be a *5 Pull Finesse*, so Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position*. It is red 1 and it successfully plays.
  * From Cathy's perspective, she initially concluded that Alice's number 5 clue was just a *5 Stall*. However, Bob blind-played his *Finesse Position* card, and Cathy knows that Bob would not do that if the move was a *5 Stall*. This must be a *5 Pull Finesse*, so Cathy blind-plays her slot 4 card. It is red 2 and it successfully plays.
* As you would expect, it is also possible to perform a *5 Pull Double Finesse*. The "pulled" card will always match the final blind-play.
* Unlike other types of *Finesses*, *5 Pulls* are **not** allowed to initiate a *Reverse Finesse*. (This is because we don't want the person with the pulled card to have to entertain too many possibilities.)
* With that said, players **do** have to respect that forward *5 Pull Finesses* could be *Layered* or *Clandestine*.
* Remember that during a *5 Pull Finesse*, the pulled card **always** matches the blind-play. In other words, it generally impossible to ever perform a *5 Pull Bluff*, a *5 Pull Double Bluff*, a *5 Pull Pestilent Double Bluff*, and so on.

### The 5 Pull Promise (A Follow-up Play Clue After a 5 Pull)

* Normally, *5 Pulls* have to be treated as *Delayed Play Clues*. This means that sometimes, it can take a long time for the pulled card to blind-play.
* From the perspective of the player who is *5 Pulled*, if a follow up *Play Clue* is given to a currently unplayable card, then they can disregard the *Delayed Play Clue* interpretation - the *5 Pulled* player is **promised** the card that makes the unplayable card playable.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * Alice has two clued 1's in her hand - red 1 and blue 1.
  * Bob does a *5 Pull* on Donald. Donald knows that the *5 Pulled* card could be either red 2 or blue 2 (if it is a *Delayed Play Clue*).
  * Cathy clues Alice about a red 3. Now, Donald knows that he is **promised** the red 2 as his *5 Pulled* card (and he no longer has to wait for the blue 1 to come down before blind-playing).

### Finesses While 5 Pulled

* Sometimes, a *5 Pulled* player may not play their pulled card right away. Maybe they have to wait for existing cards to play first, or maybe they want to capitalize on a *Finesse* while it is still available.
* Any *Finesse* that a *5 Pulled* player performs is to be treated as a *Certain Finesse*.
* Any *Certain Discard* that is performed in response to a *Finesse* that a *5 Pulled* player did applies to the *5 Pulled* card.

### The 5 Pull Skip

* If a player is already *Finessed*, it is possible to *Finesse* them again and get them to play their *Second Finesse Position* card.
* Similarly, if a *5 Pull* is performed, and the card immediately to the right of a 5 is already clued or already "gotten", then the *5 Pull* skips over that card and gets the next card after that.

## Level 14 - Scholar

* Level 14 strategies should only be learned if you have 240+ games of experience with the group.
* This level covers moves that are complicated, difficult to see, or require a deeper understanding of how Hanabi works in order to work properly.
* See the [learning path document](Learning_Path.md) for general descriptions of each level.

### The Occupied Play Clue & The Occupied Finesse (OPC)

* If a clue could be given by multiple players, who should give the clue? Usually, it makes the most sense for the players with playable cards to play those cards, and the players with nothing to do to give the clue.
* If someone gives a clue with a playable card in their hand and this forces the next player to have nothing to do, this is bad teamwork - unless there was a reason!
* When this occurs, even if the clue looks like an ordinary *Save Clue*, it **must** be a *Play Clue*, since the player who was doing it was *Occupied*.
* Furthermore, if an *Occupied Play Clue* is given to a card that is not directly playable right now, it must be an *Occupied Finesse*!
* Note that the concept of being *Occupied* generalizes to lots of different kind of moves. For example, when an *Occupied* player clues an off-chop 5, it is certainly not a *5 Stall* - it must be an *Occupied 5 Pull*!

### The Trash Push

* Normally, when a useless card is clued, it signifies a *Trash Chop Move*. However, what if the useless card is actually the card on chop? Then it wouldn't be *Chop Moving* anything.
* From *Good Touch Principle*, we know that it is pointless to spend a clue to touch a useless card on someone's chop, because if we just do nothing, the useless card will get automatically discarded.
* Subsequently, if this is done deliberately, it must have a meaning. By doing this, it means that we want to "push" the card that is next to the useless card onto the table.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All of the 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Bob has no clued cards in his hand. His chop is his slot 5.
  * Alice clues Bob number 1, which only touches his slot 5 card.
  * Bob blind-plays his slot 4 card, and it is a playable red 2.
* Sometimes, a *Trash Push* is the only way to get a card played that is sitting between two other annoying cards.
* Similar to a *Bluff*, *Trash Pushes* must be immediately playable and should generally be demonstrated immediately. (This is unlike other similar moves like the *5 Pull*, which may have to wait a while.)

### The Trash Bluff

* Normally, when a trash card is clued, it signifies a *Trash Chop Move* or a *Trash Push*. However, for both of these strategies to work, it is assumed that the recipient of the clue will know that the card that was touched is useless.
* What if the recipient of the clue does **not** know that the card that the clued card is trash? Then, they will go on to misplay that card, mistaking it for a "normal" *Play Clue*.
* If players misrepresent the identity of a trash card in this way, it is a signal for the next person to blind-play their *Finesse Position* card. This is extremely similar to how a *Finesse* or a *Bluff* works (e.g. a clued card has been misrepresented as being immediately playable).
* *Trash Bluffs* are a good tool to get a card played that is sitting behind other annoying cards.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * On the stacks, all of the 1's are played **except** for red 1.
  * Cathy has no clued cards in her hand.
  * Alice clues Cathy number 1, which only touches her newest (slot 1) card. This card is a blue 1, but Cathy will assume that it is a red 1.
  * Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card, and it is a playable blue 2.
  * Cathy now knows that her 1 must not be red 1, or else Bob would not have blind-played anything. The 1 must be some other trash card.
* Just like normal *Bluffs*, *Trash Bluffs* can only be done while in *Bluff Seat*.
* Normal *Bluffs* take precedence over *Trash Bluffs*. This means that players can **only** use cards to *Trash Bluff* with if they will be proved to be trash by a blind-play.
  * For example, if not all of the 1's have been played on the stacks, then you can use a number 1 clue to initiate a *Trash Bluff*, because a blind-play will prove that the clued 1 is not a good 1.
  * For example, if the red stack is played up to the red 3, then you **cannot** use a red clue to initiate a *Trash Bluff*, because a blind-play will make the clued card look like the red 5.
  * For example, if the red stack is played up to the red 4, then you can use a red clue to initiate a *Trash Bluff*, because a blind-play will prove that the clued card is not a red 5.
* In the case where multiple cards are clued as part of a *Trash Bluff*, **all** of the touched cards are considered to be trash. However, the focus of the clue should be the first thing discarded, which allows for the possibility of your teammates to give a follow-up *Fix Clue*.

### The Trash Finesse (Strong Form)

* In a *Finesse*, we would say that the clue "matches" the blind-play. For example, a blue clue on a blue 2 matches a blind-play of blue 1. Or, a number 2 clue on blue 2 matches a blind-play of blue 1.
* In a *Bluff*, we would say that the clue does not "match" the blind-play. For example, a blue clue on a blue 2 does not match a blind-play of a red 1. Or, a number 2 clue on a blue 2 does not match the blind-play of a red 2.
* In the *Trash Bluff* example above, a blue 1 is used to *Trash Bluff* a blue 2. Similar to a *Bluff*, we would say this number 1 clue does not match the blind-play of a blue 2.
* What if the *Trash Bluff* instead got a red 1 to blind-play? In this context, the red 1 would actually "match" the number 1 clue. Another way of saying this is that by cluing the trash 1 with a number 1 clue, the clue giver is saying that they **see** a matching 1 that is good.
* Thus, it is possible to perform a *Trash Bluff* outside of *Bluff Seat* if the "matching" card is on someone's *Finesse Position*. When this is done, it promises that someone has that specific card, so we call it a *Trash Finesse* rather than a *Trash Bluff*.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * All the 1's are played on the stacks except for red 1.
  * Alice clues number 1 to Donald, which touches a blue 1. To Donald, this will look like it is a red 1.
  * At first glance, Bob might think this is a *Trash Bluff*, causing him to blind-play his *Finesse Position* card as either red 1 or some other currently-playable card.
  * However, Bob also sees that Cathy has a red 1 on her *Finesse Position*. Thus, Alice's clue was a *Trash Finesse* instead of a *Trash Bluff*, since it is promises a playable 1.
  * Thus, Bob discards.
  * Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card and it is red 1.
  * Donald discards his known-trash 1.
* *Double Trash Finesses* are explicitly disallowed. Thus, it is possible to perform a *Trash Finesse* in a situation like this:
  * All the 1's are played on the stacks except for red 1 and blue 1.
  * Alice clues number 1 to Donald, which touches two green 1's on slot 1 and 2. To Donald, this will look like it is both the red 1 and the blue 1.
  * Like in the previous example, Bob sees that Cathy has a red 1 on her *Finesse Position*.
  * At first glance, Bob might think that Alice is promising both red 1 and blue 1, which would mean that he would need to blind-play the blue 1.
  * However, a *Trash Finesse* only promises at least one matching card, and since he sees that Cathy has a matching card, then that is good enough. Thus, Bob discards.
  * Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card and it is red 1.
  * Donald knows that the focus of the clue (slot 1) is certainly trash, since that caused Cathy to blind-play.
  * Furthermore, Donald knows that his slot 2 card is also trash, because all the cards touched in a *Trash Bluff* or *Trash Finesse* are guaranteed to be trash.

### The Reverse Trash Finesse

* First, see the section on the *[Trash Finesse (Strong Form)](the-trash-finesse-strong-form)*.
* It is also possible to perform a *Trash Finesse* in reverse. This is much harder to see than a forward *Trash Finesse*. Even so, players should generally entertain the possibility of this occurring.
* When a clue looks like it could be a *Reverse Trash Finesse*, the player who receives the clue is forced into immediately discarding the card. If it was indeed a *Reverse Trash Finesse*, it will be a trash card and it will immediately demonstrate what is going on. Alternatively, if the clue was a normal *Play Clue* on a playable card, then the discard will be a *Gentleman's Discard*. By discarding, it covers both cases.
* For example, in 3-player game:
  * The red 1 is played on the stacks. All of the 2's are played on the other stacks.
  * Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching his slot 1 card as a *Play Clue*.
  * From Bob's perspective, this is probably just a *Play Clue* on the red 2 (which happens to be the final 2 that needs to be played).
  * However, Bob sees that Cathy also has a red 2 on her *Finesse Position*. That means that this could be a *Reverse Trash Finesse*.
  * If it is a *Reverse Trash Finesse*, then his 2 is a trash 2 (e.g. green 2). By immediately discarding it, it will prove to Cathy that *she* has a red 2.
  * Alternatively, if Bob does indeed have the red 2, then he can discard it to perform a *Gentleman's Discard* on Cathy.
  * Either way, discarding will cover both cases. Bob discards the 2 and it is revealed to be a green 2.
  * Cathy comes next. Cathy was highly surprised when Alice gave Bob a number 2 clue on the green 2. From Cathy's perspective of Bob's perspective, the green 2 clue would immediately misplay as red 2. However, when Bob discards the green 2 instead of playing it, Alice's plan becomes clear. Cathy had the red 2 all along. Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card as red 2.
* Note that *Reverse Trash Finesses* should not always be entertained and **depend on context**. Specifically, towards the end of the game, *Reverse Trash Finesses* are "turned off". This is because towards the end of the game, the team needs tempo, and *Reverse Trash Finesses* are slow and require even more discarding.

### A Trash Flowchart

There are a lot of different moves that involve cluing trash. [Here is a handy flowchart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/master/img/flowcharts/cluing_trash_flowchart.png) for determining the difference between the different types of special moves that touch trash. (The flowchart contains some strategies that have not been covered yet, but the three most important moves to understand are the *Trash Chop Move*, the *Trash Finesse/Bluff*, and the *Trash Push*.)

### The Out-of-Order Finesse (Triple O / OOO)

* Sometimes, a *Finesse* is initiated by giving a color clue to two or more cards where the next card in the sequence is clued, but it is **not** the focus of the clue.
* When this happens, the *Finesse* will still work: a player will blind-play a matching card. However, a *Fix Clue* must then be given to the player who originally received the clue, or they will go on to misplay.
* Normally, after receiving a *Fix Clue*, a player would normally "stop" and not assume anything else about his hand. However, this is a special situation: when the original *Finesse* was given, it was a message that the focus of the clue was playable. *Information Lock Principle* applies, and it means that the original focus of the clue is also playable.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * At the beginning of the game, Alice goes first.
  * Bob has a red 3 and a red 2 (on slots 1 and 2 respectively).
  * Cathy has a red 1 on slot 1 (in *Finesse Position*).
  * Alice clues Bob red (as an *Out-of-Order Reverse Finesse*). The focus of the clue is the red 3 on slot 1.
  * Bob sees the red 1 on Cathy's *Finesse Position*, so he has to respect that it could be *Reverse Finesse*. Bob discards.
  * Cathy blind-plays red 1.
  * Alice must now give a *Fix Clue* to Bob, or else red 3 will be misplayed as red 2.
  * Alice clues number 2 to Bob.
  * Bob plays red 2.
  * Bob knows that his other red card **must** be red 3, since it was originally clued as playable and it caused a *Reverse Finesse*.

### Finesses with a Lie Component

* *Good Lie Principle* states all that lies must resolve immediately. However, some players will occasionally perform *Finesses* that violate this principle. We would say that such *Finesses* have a *Lie Component*.
* Typically, when players lie out of *Bluff Seat*, the game quickly falls apart; subsequent clues will have different meanings to different players and everyone will become "desynchronized". This typically leads to a loss.
* With that said, it is sometimes possible to construct **safe** lines that contain a *Lie Component*. There is usually deep levels of nuance involved in these lines, so this kind of thing is only recommended for advanced and expert players.
* The previously mentioned *Out-of-Order Finesse* is a specific example of a *Finesse* with a *Lie Component*. One key attribute of the *Out-of-Order Finesse* is that the player who receives the *Fix Clue* knows that **all** of the related cards are playable, or it would not have been worth the risk (and the confusion) to perform a line with a *Lie Component* in the first place.
* This concept can be generalized to all *Finesses* that have a *Lie Component*. After a player receives a *Fix Clue* in such a situation, they should assume that the *Finesse* is "still on". So, depending on the situation, they should either know that the initial card that was clued is playable (like in an *Out-of-Order Finesse*) or continue to blind-play cards to fulfill the initial *Finesse* (if the card clued with a *Fix Clue* seems to be unrelated).
* Importantly, *Finesses* with a *Lie Component* are **only** allowed if there is not an alternative line that would "get" the same number of cards without any lies. Thus, if you are looking to do a *Finesse* with a *Lie Component*, make sure you carefully consider the efficiency of all of the possible alternatives.

## Level 15 - Erudite

* Level 15 strategies should only be learned if you have 260+ games of experience with the group.
* This level introduces *Discharges*.
* See the [learning path document](Learning_Path.md) for general descriptions of each level.

### Discharge

* *Discharge* is similar to *Ejection*, except instead of blind-playing the *Second Finesse Position* card, the player plays the *Third Finesse Position* card.
* Just like a *Bluff*, a *Discharge* can only be performed on the very next player.
* Several different kinds of moves can cause a *Discharge*. The most common one is called the *Unknown Trash Discharge*.

### The Unknown Trash Discharge (UTD)

* In general, *Bluffs* work because the blind-play tells the person who was clued that they have a *one-away-from-playable* card of that color.
* In general, *Trash Bluffs* work because the blind-play tells the person who was clued that they have a trash card.
* Players must be careful to not give a *Trash Bluff* that looks like a *Bluff* - that will desynchronize the team.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* and it successfully plays as blue 2.
  * Cathy knows that a *Bluff* has occurred and marks her red card as red 3 (the *one-away-from-playable* red card).
  * Of course, this is a lie, because Cathy's red card is actually a red 1. The team will likely get a misplay at some point in the future.
* If the above example happens and Alice is not making a mistake, then Alice must be trying to communicate something extra. This should signal an *Discharge* on the very next player.
* Since the *Third Finesse Position* card was played instead of the *Finesse Position* card, then the player who received the clue will know that the card is trash.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob knows that if he played his *First Finesse Position*, then Cathy would write a note of red 3 on the card (as a *Bluff*), which would be a lie.
  * Bob knows that if he played his *Second Finesse Position*, then Cathy would write a note of red 5 on the card (as a *5 Color Ejection*), which would be a lie.
  * Bob blind-plays his *Third Finesse Position*, and it successfully plays as green 2.
  * Cathy knows that a *Discharge* has occurred from Alice's red clue. Thus, this must be an *Unknown Trash Discharge*, so Cathy's red card must be trash. Cathy marks her red card as red 1 (since that is the only possible trash red card) and discards it.
* When multiple cards are clued with an *Unknown Trash Discharge*, **only the focus of the clue is considered to be trash**. This means that *Good Touch Principle* applies to the non-focused cards. (Note that this is **the opposite of the *Trash Bluff***. In a *Trash Bluff*, when multiple cards are clued, **all** of the touched cards are considered to be trash.)

## Level 16 - Expert

* Level 16 strategies should only be learned if you have 280+ games of experience with the group.
* This level covers *Double Bluffs* and all of the complicated stipulations that go along with them.
* See the [learning path document](Learning_Path.md) for general descriptions of each level.

### The Double Half Bluff

* Sometimes, you see that two players in a row have playable *Finesse Position* cards. However, they are unrelated, so you can't get them both played with a *Double Finesse*. In this situation, by performing a clue that looks like a *Double Finesse*, you can get the first card played like a normal *Finesse* and the second card like a *Bluff*.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Donald red, which touches a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob goes next and assumes that it is a *Double Self-Finesse* - he has the red 2 and red 3 in his two newest slots. Thus, he blind-plays his left-most and it is red 2, as expected.
  * Cathy goes next. Cathy sees that Bob does **not** have red 3 in his *Second Finesse Position* (and no one else has a red 3 in their *Finesse Position* either). Thus, Cathy must have the red 3. Cathy tries to blind-play red 3 from her *Finesse Position*, but is blue 1 instead.
  * Bob now knows he does not have the red 3 anymore, since Cathy blind-played.
  * Cathy now knows that since two blind-plays happened in a row, she does **not** have the red 3 and that she was *Bluffed*.
  * At first, Donald thought that the red card in his hand was red 2 (as a *Play Clue*).
  * After Bob blind-played, Donald thought that the red card in his hand was red 3 (as a *Finesse*).
  * After Cathy blind-played, Donald knows that he must have the red 4 (as a *Double Half Bluff*).
* Normally, players are only allowed to perform *Bluffs* while sitting in *Bluff Seat*. The *Double Half Bluff* is one of the few exceptions to the rule. (It is allowed because the lie still resolves "immediately", which satisfies *Good Lie Principle*.)

### The Double Bluff

* Similar to a *Double Half Bluff*, it is also possible to get 2 cards played in a row that are completely unrelated. It is distinct from a *Double Half Bluff* because **none** of the blind-played cards match the card that is clued.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * Red 1 is currently played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Donald red, which touches a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Since red 4 must be playable right now, Bob thinks he has the red 2 and the red 3. Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card, but it is actually a blue 1.
  * Cathy sees that Bob blind-played because of the red clue. However, since the red 4 is a two-away from playable card instead of a *one-away-from-playable* card, it must mean that it is a *Double Bluff* instead of a single *Bluff*. Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card and it is yellow 1.
  * At first, Donald thought that the red card in his hand was red 2 (as a *Play Clue*).
  * After Bob blind-played, Donald thought that the red card in his hand was red 3 (as a *Bluff*).
  * After Cathy blind-played, Donald knows that he must have the red 4 (as a *Double Bluff*).
* Normally, players are only allowed to perform *Bluffs* while sitting in *Bluff Seat*. The *Double Bluff* is one of the few exceptions to the rule. (It is allowed because the lie still resolves "immediately", which satisfies *Good Lie Principle*.)

### The Triple Bluff (Illegal)

* A *Double Bluff* is when a player clues a card that is two-away-from-playable and it gets two unrelated cards to blind-play from *Finesse Position*.
* Logically, it follows from the *Double Bluff* that if a player clues a card that is three-away-from-playable, it would cause three unrelated cards to blind-play from *Finesse Position* as a *Triple Bluff*.
* However, this is not the case. We explicitly agree that *Triple Bluffs* are illegal and not to be used. (*Triple One-Third Bluffs* and *Triple Two-Third Bluffs* are also illegal.)
* The consequence of this is that if a player gives a *Play Clue* to a three-away-from-playable card (e.g. either a 4 or a 5) and it causes two cards to blind-play, then the next player should **not** continue to blind-play any more cards. See the next section for more information.

### The 4 Double Bluff & The 5 Double Bluff

* Since *Triple Bluffs* are illegal and not to be used, it is possible to perform a *Double Bluff* with a card that is not exactly two-away-from-playable. This is similar to how the *3 Bluff* convention works.
* This is how it works for 4's:
  * If a 4 is given a *Play Clue* and it is *one-away-from-playable*, then it would only trigger a single *Bluff* (and not a *Double Bluff*).
  * If a 4 is given a *Play Clue* and it is two-away-from-playable, then it would trigger a *Double Bluff*. (This would be a "normal" *Double Bluff*.)
  * If a 4 is given a *Play Clue* and it is three-away-from-playable, then it would still only trigger a double *Bluff* (as a *4's Double Bluff* specifically).
* This is how it works for 5's:
  * If a 5 is given a *Play Clue* and it is *one-away-from-playable*, then it would only trigger a single *Bluff* (and not a *Double Bluff*).
  * If a 5 is given a *Play Clue* and it is two-away-from-playable, then it would trigger a *Double Bluff*. (This would be a "normal" *Double Bluff*.)
    * Note that this would only happen if e.g. *5 Color Ejection* and *5 Number Discharge* would not apply.
  * If a 5 is given a *Play Clue* and it is three-away-from-playable, then it would still only trigger a double *Bluff* (as a *5's Double Bluff* specifically).
    * Note that this would only happen if e.g. *5 Color Ejection* and *5 Number Discharge* would not apply.
  * If a 5 is given a *Play Clue* and it is four-away-from-playable, then it would still only trigger a double *Bluff* (as a *5's Double Bluff* specifically).
    * Note that this would only happen if e.g. *5 Color Ejection* and *5 Number Discharge* would not apply.
* For example, in a 5-player game:
  * Nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Donald red, which touches a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob tries to blind-play red 1 from his *Finesse Position*, but he instead plays a blue 1.
  * Cathy knows that this must be a *Double Bluff*. She blind-plays yellow 1 from her *Finesse Position*.
  * Now, it is Donald's turn.
    * At first, Donald thought that the red card in his hand was red 1 (as a *Play Clue*).
    * After Bob blind-played, Donald thought that the red card in his hand was either a red 2 (as a *Bluff*) or a red 3 (as a *3 Bluff*).
    * After Cathy blind-played, Donald now knows that the red card in his hand is a red 4 (as a *4's Double Bluff*).
      * (Donald knows that it cannot be a red 5, or else Bob would have blind-played his *Second Finesse Position*.)

### The 4 Double Bluff That Looks like a Double Half Bluff

* Because any *Bluff* sequence that gets two cards blind-played can be a 4, this means that players have to account for the fact that a card that initiates a *Double Half Bluff* could also be a 4.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Donald, touching a red 3 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob blind-plays red 1.
  * Cathy blind-plays blue 1.
  * Normally, Donald would know that his red card is exactly a red 3, as a *Double Half Bluff*.
  * However, Donald also knows that any 4 in the game can be used to perform a *Double Bluff*.
  * Thus, Donald marks his red card as either a red 3 (if it was a *Double Half Bluff*) or a red 4 (if it was a *4 Double Bluff*).

## Level 17 - Rarely Used Strategies

* Level 17 strategies are separated from the rest because they do not come up that often. Thus, non-expert players do not have to worry about learning them. If they do come up in a game, players with experience can often figure out what to do on-the-fly. Even if they don't, they can quickly learn about them in the post-game review, and then use the document as a reference later on in case they need to refresh their memory.

## Level 17 - Rarely Used Strategies - Special Finesses

### The Selfish Finesse (A Finesse Through Your Own Hand)

* First, see the section on the *[Selfish Clue](#the-selfish-clue)*.
* One excellent reason to give a *Selfish Clue* is to "lock in" a *Finesse* before the cards move out of *Finesse Position*. This is called a *Selfish Finesse*.
* Like any other *Finesse*, players in this situation should just mark the cards for later and wait patiently for the cluer to play their card.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Bob, touching a red 1 on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*. (This is now a globally-known red 1, since Cathy does not have any red 1's in her hand.)
  * Bob clues red to Cathy, touching a red 3 on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Cathy sees that Alice has as red 2 on her *Finesse Position*, so this must be a *Selfish Finesse*. Bob did not want to play the red 1 because then the *Finesse* might go away and he wanted to lock it in. Cathy marks her red card as potentially red 3 and discards.
  * Alice sees that Bob gave a *Play Clue* to a red 3. Bob knows for sure that he has the red 1, so Alice must have the red 2 on her *Finesse Position*. Alice marks her *Finesse Position* card as red 2 and discards.
  * Bob plays red 1.
  * Cathy discards.
  * Alice blind-plays red 2.

### The Layered Priority Finesse

* Similar to a normal *Layered Finesse*, it is also possible to initiate a *Layered Priority Finesse* as long as the blind-playing player is not the very next person.

### The Bad Touch Layered Finesse that Causes a Blind-Play of a Known Dupe (Dupe Bluffs / Bluff Dupes)

* If a player performs a *Bluff* that causes a blind-play of a globally-known duplicated card, that is quite strange. Doing this is not very good, as it violates *Good Touch Principle* and does not accomplish very much in general.
* Players agree that this is not a *Bluff* at all, but instead a *Layered Finesse*. The player who blind-played the card should continue to blind-play cards until they find the promised card.
* This section also applies to *Priority Bluffs* that cause the blind-play of a duplicated card.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice has a globally-known red 3 in her hand. (It is "filled in" with both a red clue and a number 3 clue.)
  * Alice clues blue to Cathy, touching a blue 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob knows that this must be a *Finesse*, so he attempts to blind-play a blue 3 from his *Finesse Position*. Instead, he blind-plays a red 3.
  * Cathy discards her chop.
  * Alice discards her known red 3 (since it is already played and is now trash).
  * Bob knows that *Bluffs* that duplicate a card like this are supposed to be treated as *Layered Finesses*. Bob blind-plays his *Second Finesse Position* as blue 3 and it successfully plays.

### Potential Priority Duplication & The Certain Priority Finesse (or Priority Certain Finesse)

* Normally, players can perform any particular type of *Finesse* either by giving a clue or by playing a card without *Priority*. For example, it is possible to both do a *Layered Finesse* (by giving a clue) and a *Layered Priority Finesse* (by playing a card).
* One exception to this rule is the *Certain Finesse*. When a player perform a *Certain Finesse*, it calls for a *Certain Discard*. However, when a player uses *Priority* to promise a card that could potentially be in their own hand, this should **not** induce a *Certain Discard*. The other players in this situation should just ignore the *Priority* and instead discard their chop card. (Doing it this way is much safer because it allow potential *Layered Finesses* as well as some slack for mistakes.)

### The No-Information Double Finesse & The No-Information Double Bluff

* Sometimes, cards are re-clued in order to initiate a *Finesse* or a *Bluff*. Most times, the clue will "fill in" or give extra information to the existing card.
* Other times, the clue will give no information (e.g. re-cluing number 3 to an already known 3). In this situation, if it was merely a *Bluff*, it would be pretty low value.
* Thus, by convention, a "no information" clue **must** "get" at least 2 new cards (as opposed to a single *Bluff* that only gets 1 brand new card).
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues 3's to Cathy, which touches one 3, the red 3.
  * Bob blind-plays blue 1. At this point, everyone knows that Alice has performed a *3 Bluff*, and from Cathy's perspective, her 3 can be any 3 at all.
  * Cathy discards.
  * Alice clues 3's to Cathy, which re-touches the red 3 (and gives no additional information to it).
  * Bob blind-plays red 1. If this was a *3 Bluff*, then no-one would be promised the red 2. However, since no new information was given, it must be a *No-Information Double Finesse*. Bob sees that Cathy does not have the red 2, so he must have the red 2, and can blind-play it on his next turn.
* Usually, a "no-information" clue conveys a *Double Finesse*. But you can also use it to perform a *Double Bluff* (or a *Double Half Bluff*). For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues 3's to Cathy, which touches one 3, the red 3.
  * Bob blind-plays blue 1. At this point, everyone knows that Alice has performed a *3 Bluff*, and from Cathy's perspective, her 3 can be any 3 at all.
  * Cathy discards.
  * Alice clues 3's to Cathy, which re-touches the red 3 (and gives no additional information to it).
  * Bob blind-plays green 1. If this was a *3 Bluff*, then no-one would be promised the green 2. However, since no new information was given, it must be a *No-Information Double Finesse*.
  * Cathy sees that Bob does not have the green 2, so she must have the green 2, so she blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card, and it is yellow 1 instead of green 2.
  * Since two cards were blind-played (that did not match), everyone now knows that the *No-Information* clue was a *Double Bluff* instead of a *Double Finesse*. From Cathy's perspective, her 3 can (still) be any 3 at all.
* The "no-information" principle can also be used to perform a *Layered Finesse* on the next player. (The next player will know that it is a *Layered Finesse* instead of a *Bluff* because some other more-useful clue could have been given to initiate the *Bluff*.)

### The Bad Touch Finesse (For 1's)

* In the *Trash Finesse* / *Trash Bluff*, it is possible to clue number 1 to a player in order to get someone to blind-play a card.  After the blind-play, it is understood that all of the 1's are trash.
* However, what if this is done on the first turn of the game, touching two 1's? If nothing is played on the stacks, then the 1 of every single suit is needed. In this situation, both of the 1's that are clued cannot be trash.
* In this situation, the 1's clue only communicates that *Good Touch Principle* was violated and that both of the 1's are the same suit.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Cathy's hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: `green 4, red 1, red 1, red 5, green 5`
  * Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching the two red 1's.
  * Bob sees that instead of violating *Good Touch Principle*, Alice could have instead simply performed a *5 Save* to Cathy.
  * Bob knows that since we are not normally supposed to violate *Good Touch Principle*, Alice must be trying to communicate something extra. Therefore, this must be a *Bad Touch Finesse*. Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  * Cathy knows that since this is the first turn of the game, both of her 1's cannot be trash. Similar to a *Stale 1's Clue*, Cathy skips over the older 1 and plays the newest 1. (She would normally play her 1's from right-to-left.) Cathy will then discard the other one later.
* If a *Bad Touch Finesse* is performed on three or more 1s, it only promises that the oldest one is trash / duplicated.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Cathy's hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: `green 1, red 1, red 1, red 5, green 5`
  * Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching slot 1, slot 2, and slot 3.
  * Bob sees that instead of violating *Good Touch Principle*, Alice could have instead simply performed a *5 Save* to Cathy.
  * Bob knows that since we are not normally supposed to violate *Good Touch Principle*, Alice must be trying to communicate something extra. Therefore, this must be a *Bad Touch Finesse*. Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  * Cathy knows that since this is the first turn of the game, all of her 1's cannot be trash. Similar to a *Stale 1's Clue*, Cathy skips over the oldest 1 (on slot 3) and plays the middle 1 (on slot 2). (She would normally play her 1's from right-to-left.) On Cathy's next turn, she will play the left-most 1. On Cathy's next turn after that, she will discard the right-most 1 (the one that she originally skipped over).

### The Bad Touch Finesse (For 2's)

* Normally, if number 2 is clued to a chop card, it is considered to be a *Save Clue* (as the *2 Save* convention).
* However, it is possible for players to transform this *Save Clue* interpretation into a *Play Clue* interpretation if they violate *Good Touch Principle* and intentionally duplicate another 2.
* In this situation, the player who received the clue will know that the chop card matches.
  * If two 2's were clued, then the other 2 is obviously the exact same copy as the chop 2. In this situation, the left-most card can be played and the other card discarded as known trash.
  * If three or more 2's were clued, then any of the other cards could be the duplicated 2. In this situation, the chop card should be discarded and then *Elimination Notes* for that card written on the other 2's.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 2 to Cathy, touching a red 2 on slot 3 and a red 2 on slot 5 (her chop).
  * Bob knows that normally, this would be a *2 Save* on the red 2. However, Alice is violating *Good Touch Principle*, so she must be trying to communicate something extra.
  * Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card and it is red 1.
  * Cathy knows that since a clue that looks like a *2 Save* got Bob to blind-play something, then both of the 2's must be red 2. Cathy plays the 2 on slot 3 and plans to discard the 2 on slot 5 on her next turn.
* The *Bad Touch Finesse* is contextual and does not always apply:
  * If the clue giver was an *Occupied*, then it is an *Occupied Play Clue* and the other 2's are not necessarily duplicated.
  * If the clue giver gave a *2 Save* early and had other *Play Clues* to give instead, the clue could be so bad that it would trigger a *Finesse* and the other 2's are not necessarily duplicated.

### The Bad Touch Bluff (For 2's)

* In the same way as the *Bad Touch Finesse*, it is also possible to *Bad Touch Bluff* in order to get unrelated cards played from *Finesse Position*.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Blue 2 and green 2 are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 2 to Cathy, touching a red 2 on slot 3 and a red 2 on slot 5 (her chop).
  * Bob knows that normally, this would be a *2 Save* on the red 2. However, Alice is violating *Good Touch Principle*, so she must be trying to communicate something extra. Therefore, this must be a *Bad Touch Finesse*.
  * Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card, trying to play the red 1. Instead, it is is blue 3 and it successfully plays.
  * Cathy knows that since a clue that looked like a *2 Save* got Bob to blind-play something, then a duplication occurred and both of the 2's must be the same. Cathy discards the chop card and saves the other one for later.

### The Bad Touch Double Finesse (For 3's)

* Normally, a *3 Bluff* takes priority over a *Double Finesse*. This means that if someone clues a blue 3 using the number 3, and then a blue 1 blind-plays on the very next turn, no-one is promised the blue 2.
* However, if **both** blue 3's were touched with the number 3 clue, then that would violate *Good Touch Principle*, and this would be considered a "bad touch".
* If someone is violating *Good Touch Principle*, they must have a very good reason, so the clue must be a *Double Finesse* instead of a *3 Bluff*. In the above example, the next player should blind-play the blue 2 from their *Finesse Position*.
* After that, the player who received the clue can safely discard the focused 3.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 3 to Donald, touching two red 3's.
  * Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* and it is red 1.
  * Cathy knows that normally, this would be a *3 Bluff*. However, since the red 3's are duplicated, this must be a *Bad Touch Double Finesse*, so Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* and it is the red 2.
  * Donald knows that the other 3 in his hand must be the other copy of red 3, or else Cathy would not have blind-played anything, so Donald plays the left-most red 3. The next time that Donald discards, he will discard the known trash red 3.

### The Bad Touch Layered Finesse That Dupes a Clued Card (Illegal)

* First, see the section on the *[Bad Touch Double Finesse (For 3's)](#the-bad-touch-double-finesse-for-3s)*.
* Similar to a *Bad Touch Double Finesse (For 3's)*, it is also possible to try a *Bad Touch Layered Finesse* on the next player.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * No cards are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues both copies of red 3 in Cathy's hand.
  * Bob blind-plays a blue 1.
  * Bob knows that if only one red 3 was touched, this would just be a normal *3 Bluff*. However, since there was a bad touch, he knows that he must continue to blind-play cards until he finds the red 1 and the red 2.
* *Bad Touch Layered Finesses* are **explicitly illegal** because they violate *Good Lie Principle* - Bob cannot demonstrate that it is a bad touch until after Cathy has already taken a turn.

### The Bad Touch Double Bluff (For 3's)

* In the same way as the *Bad Touch Double Finesse*, it is also possible to *Bad Touch Double Bluff* (or *Bad Touch Double Half Bluff*) in order to get unrelated cards played from *Finesse Position*.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 3 to Donald, touching two red 3's.
  * Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* and it is blue 1.
  * Cathy knows that normally, this would be a *3 Bluff*. However, since the red 3's are duplicated, this must be a *Bad Touch Double Bluff*, so Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* and it is the green 1.
  * Donald knows that he must have a duplicated copy of a 3, or else Cathy would not have blind-played anything. Donald discards the left-most 3.
* Instead of cluing the same 3 in one hand, it is also possible to perform a *Bad Touch Double Finesse/Bluff* by intentionally duplicating a 3 in another player's hand.
* For example, in a 5-player game:
  * All of the 1's are played except for red 1.
  * Emily has a clued red 3 in his hand.
  * Alice clues number 3 to Donald, touching a red 3 (and duplicating it, since Emily already has a copy with a clue on it).
  * Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* and it is red 1.
  * Cathy knows that normally, this would be a *3 Bluff*. However, since the red 3 was duplicated, this must be a *Bad Touch Double Finesse*, so Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* and it is the red 2.
  * Donald knows that this cannot be a *3 Bluff*, or else Cathy would not have blind-played anything. Thus, this must be a *Bad Touch Double Finesse*, so Donald discards his red 3 as a *Sarcastic Discard* to pass it back to Emily.
  * Emily plays the red 3.
* More examples of a *Bad Touch Double Bluff* can be found [here](examples/Bad_Touch_Double_Bluff.md).

### The Bad Touch Triple Finesse (For 4's)

* In the same way that it is possible to perform a *Bad Touch Double Finesse* to "get around" a *3 Bluff* interpretation, it is also possible to perform a *Bad Touch Triple Finesse* to "get around" a *4 Double Bluff* interpretation.
* For example, in a 5-player game:
  * It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 4 to Emily, touching two red 4's.
  * Bob blind-plays red 1.
  * Cathy blind-plays red 2.
  * Donald knows that normally, this would be a *4 Double Bluff* and that no-one should play any more cards. However, since the red 4 was duplicated, this must be a *Bad Touch Triple Finesse*, so Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* and it is the red 3.
  * Emily knows that this cannot be a *4 Double Bluff*, or else Donald would not have blind-played anything. Thus, this must be a *Bad Touch Triple Finesse*, so Emily plays her left-most red 4. The next time that Emily discards, she will discard the known trash red 4.

### The Repair Prompt + The Repair Finesse

* First, see the section on [Saving Playable Cards when the Preceding Cards Are Not Promptable](#saving-playable-cards-when-the-preceding-cards-are-not-promptable).
* When a player gives a clue that will "mis-*Prompt*" a player, it is almost always a situation where they need to save the playable card.
* However, if this is not the case, it is quite strange, and looks like a mistake.
* In this situation, if the "problem" card is **exactly** *one-away from being playable*, it communicates that someone else has the card to "repair" the situation and cause the *Prompt* to work out properly.
* In other words, a *Repair Prompt* is a *Prompt* that also *Prompts* other players cards at the same time.
* If players do not have any matching cards in their hand, they should instead assume a *Repair Finesse*, and blind-play the repairing card from their *Finesse Position*.
* Note that a *Repair Finesse* is very different from a *Patch Finesse*: a *Repair Finesse* is always known to the person *repairing*, but a *Patch Finesse* is always hidden from the person *patching*.
* Examples:
  * [Game #16695, turn 10](https://hanab.live/replay/16695/10)

### The Patch Finesse

* Sometimes, a player will initiate a *Layered Finesse* on a card that is behind a *one-away-from-playable* card. Normally, this would be quite bad, as the player would blind-play the *one-away-from-playable* card, and it would misplay.
* However, since the *Finesse* target is considered unplayable from the rest of the team, they can be tricked into blind-playing the exact card that makes the one-away card actually playable. This "patches" the *Layered Finesse* problem, and now the layer can be fully unwrapped without issues.
* For example, in a 5-player game:
  * All of the 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Emily, which is a *Play Clue* on a red 4.
  * Donald has a blue 3 on his *Finesse Position*, followed by a red 2 and a red 3.
  * Bob discards. (We will return to Bob at the end.)
  * Cathy sees that she must have the red 2 and red 3 on her *Finesse Position*, because even though Donald has the red 2 and the red 3, they are behind an unplayable card (blue 3).
  * Cathy tries to blind-play red 2 and it is instead a blue 2.
  * Donald knew that Alice's clue was *Finessing* him, since no-one else on the team has any red cards. So, he gasps in surprise when Cathy blind-plays for seemingly no reason.
  * However, Donald knows that he should trust Alice and he should trust Cathy, so he continues to assume that he has the red 2.
  * Donald tries to blind-play red 2 and it is instead the blue 3. Donald now knows that this is a *Patch Finesse*.
  * Emily sees the playable red 2 and red 3 in Donald's hand, so she also knows that this was a *Patch Finesse*. The red card in her hand is either red 3 or red 4.
  * We skipped over Bob - why did he discard? Normally, Bob should think the same thing as Cathy - that he has both the red 2 and the red 3. However, Bob can look ahead and see that a *Patch Finesse* could occur, so he has to give precedence to that interpretation and wait to see what will happen. He should try to blind-play the red 2 himself on the next round if no other blind-plays occur.

### The Known Patch Finesse (Illegal)

* Legal *Patch Finesses* are **always hidden**, meaning that from the person who is blind-playing a card to "patch" will **never** know that it is a *Patch Finesse* until **after** they blind-play.
* In other words, if Alice performs a legal *Patch Finesse*, then **no-one else on the team has to even know that the *Patch Finesse* convention exists** - everything will just work out properly because everyone will just blind-play cards like any other ordinary *Layered Finesse*.
  * The exception is when it comes time for the patched player to begin blind-playing. In this situation, the patched player might be "spooked" from the blind-play of the patcher, because they will not understand why the blind-play happened. In this situation, players need to have full trust and not be spooked by unexpected successful blind-play from other people on the team.

### The Double Patch Finesse (Illegal)

* Building on the *Patch Finesse*, it is theoretically possible for a *Patch Finesse* to require **two** separate players to patch at the same time.
* However, we expressly forbid this because it is too confusing. Players should **never** consider the possibility of a *Patch Finesse* with two *Patch Components*.

### The Patch Gentleman's Discard (Illegal)

* Theoretically, it could be possible to perform a *Gentleman's Discard* that contains a *Patch Component*.
* However, we explicitly disallow this. *Gentleman's Discards* **must** be for cards that are on slot 1. Otherwise, it would communicate a *Blaze Discard*.

### The Trash Finesse (Weak Form)

* First, see the section on *[Trash Touch Elimination](#trash-touch-elimination)*.
* When players deliberately touch ancillary trash and there is only one card "missing", then it should trigger *Trash Touch Elimination Notes*. But what if there are two or more cards that are missing?
* In this situation, the clue giver is promising that someone has one of the missing cards on their *Finesse Position*. Once the card is blind-played, the recipient of the clue will know that one of their ancillary cards are trash.
* This is more subtle than the strong *Trash Finesse*. In the strong form, the focus of the clue causes a blind-play. In the weak form, the non-focused cards are what causes the blind-play
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Red 2 is played on the stacks. All of the other suits have the 1 played on the stacks.
  * Bob's hand is, from newest to oldest: red 3, red 1, blue 1, green 1, yellow 1.
  * Alice wants to give a play clue to the red 3. Everyone on the team can see that she can give either 3s or red.
    * If she clues number 3, then it will uniquely touch the red 3 (and not violate *Good Touch Principle*).
    * If she clues red, then it will touch the red 3 and the red 1 (which **will** violate *Good Touch Principle*).
  * Alice clues red to Bob. Since nothing was stopping her from cluing number 3, this is very strange.
  * Bob plays the red 3.
  * There are two "missing" red cards - the red 4 and the red 5. Thus, Cathy knows that Alice must be intending a weak form *Trash Finesse*.
  * Cathy immediately blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card and it is the red 4.
  * Bob sees Cathy blind-play the next red card for seemingly no reason, so he is able to deduce that his slot 2 card is trash.

### The Pestilent Finesse

* First, see the section on the *[Pestilent Double Bluff](#pestilent-double-bluff)*.
* In the *Pestilent Double Bluff* example, Cathy is supposed to immediately blind-play her *Finesse Position* card in order to "heal" the situation with Bob.
* However, if Cathy sees that someone else on the team has the red 2 in their *Finesse Position*, then Cathy can see that it is a *Pestilent Finesse* instead of a *Pestilent Bluff*. Cathy can simply let the person with the actual red 2 blind-play and that will "heal" the problem in the exact same way.

### The Diseased Clandestine Finesse

* First, see the section on the *[Pestilent Double Bluff](#pestilent-double-bluff)*.
* In the *Pestilent Double Bluff* example, Cathy is supposed to immediately blind-play her *Finesse Position* card in order to "heal" the situation with Bob.
* However, if Cathy sees a clue that she can give that will turn the move into a *Clandestine Finesse* on Bob, then she must always do that.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * It is the first turn of the game and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Bob's hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: `red 1, blue 2, blue 1, blue 5`
  * Donald hand has a red 2 in it.
  * Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching a blue 2 on slot 2.
  * Bob blind-plays the red 1.
  * Cathy sees that this looks like a *Pestilent Double Bluff* situation. However, she also sees that if she gives a *Play Clue* to the red 2, Donald will play it, and then Bob will reinterpret Alice's clue as a *Clandestine Finesse*.
  * Cathy clues red to Donald, touching a red 2 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Donald plays the red 2.
  * Alice discards.
  * Originally, Bob thought that Alice had performed a *Self-Finesse* on him for the red 1 into the red 2. However, from *Good Touch Principle*, this cannot be the case anymore, because Cathy got Donald's red 2.
  * Thus, Bob's 2 must be some other 2. Bob knows that this would normally cause a *Pestilent Double Bluff*, but Cathy did not blind-play anything.
  * Thus, this must be a *Disease Clandestine Finesse*. In other words, Alice told him that his 2 was playable right now, and no-one else has blind-played any 1s, so Bob must continue to blind-play cards until his 2 is playable.
  * Bob blind-plays his slot 3 card and it successfully plays as the blue 1.
  * Bob knows that his 2 must be the blue 2 to match the blue 1.

### The Surreptitious Finesse

* *Clandestine Finesses* are when a color or rank clue "matches" the card from a blind-play, but the clue receiver must wait for **additional** matching playable cards to blind-play. Another way of saying this is that *Clandestine Finesses* have a *Misplay Component*; if the blind-player does not continue to blind-play cards, then the clue receiver will go on to misplay the "matching" card.
* A similar situation can also happen when a rank clue "matches" the card from a blind-play, but the clue receiver sees **non-matching** rank cards in the blind-player's hand that are currently playable.
* If the clue receiver waits for these non-matching cards to blind-play, and they **do** blind-play, then it means that the original clue was on a different suit than it first appeared. This is called a *Surreptitious Self-Finesse* in order to disambiguate it from a more ordinary *Clandestine Finesse*.
* *Surreptitious Finesses* have a *Misplay Component* in almost the exact same way that *Clandestine Finesses* do, but they just involve non-matching rank cards.
* Generally speaking, this means that when a **rank** clue initiates a *Finesse*, the clue receiver must always allow for the possibility that subsequent non-matching rank cards in the blind-player's hand (that are of a **lower** rank than the clue) can possibly be caught up in the *Finesse*.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 3 to Cathy, which touches one 3.
  * Bob blind-plays red 2.
  * Cathy knows that red 2 "matches" number 3, so she knows that she probably has red 3.
  * However, Cathy also sees that before Bob blind-played the red 2, he had a blue 1 in the slot right after it.
  * Thus, it is possible for Cathy's 3 to actually be blue 3. If it is, Bob will blind-play the blue 1 and Cathy will know that she has blue 2 on her *Finesse Position*.
  * So, Cathy discards (instead of potentially playing the red 3 on this turn) to allow for the possibility of a *Surreptitious Finesse*.
* Examples of a *Surreptitious Finesse* can be found [here](examples/Surreptitious_Finesse.md).

### The Distribution Finesse

* On the final round of the game, it is possible to give a *Play Clue* to a player that would be useless - they will not get a chance to play the card before the game ends.
* If a player does this anyway, then it must be communicating something extra. In this situation, it is to be interpreted as a *Finesse* instead of a *Play Clue* for the purposes of better satisfying *Team Distribution Principle*.
* Examples:
  * [Game #16887, turn 29](https://hanab.live/replay/16887/29) if Instantiation clues 5 on the red 5

### Inverted Priority Finesse

* *Priority Finesses* are considered "free", since they do not cost a clue to perform. Thus, it is extremely rare that a player would decline to perform one if it was possible to do so.
* If a player declines to perform a *Priority Finesse*, and there is nothing else special going on, then they must be trying to communicate something extra.
* They are instead calling for a *Priority Finesse* on the card that had *Priority*. This is called an *Inverted Priority Finesse* because it gets a blind-play from playing a card with *Priority* (as opposed to getting a blind-play from playing a card without *Priority*).
* After a *Inverted Priority Finesse* occurs, the presence of a normal *Priority Finesse* is now known to everyone on the team. Thus, the normal *Priority Finesse* is preserved and should be played into on the next go-around of the table.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Alice has a choice between playing a red 1 and a blue 2. Both cards are fully known, and no-one else has any clued cards, so the red 1 has *Priority*.
  * Alice plays the red 1.
  * Bob sees that if Alice had played the blue 2, she could have performed a *Priority Finesse* on Cathy's slot 1 card, the blue 3.
  * Bob knows that there was no reason for Alice to decline the *Priority Finesse*, so this must be an *Inverted Priority Finesse*. Bob blind-plays his slot 1 card, and it is the red 2.
  * Cathy knows that the red 1 had *Priority*, so playing it should not have caused Bob to blind-play anything. Thus, Cathy knows that this must be an *Inverted Priority Finesse*, and she knows that she has a blue 3 on her slot 1. Cathy discards.
  * Alice plays blue 2.
  * Bob discards.
  * Cathy blind-plays blue 3.

### The Shadow Finesse

* When playing with expert players, it is rare for them to "miss" the chance to *Finesse* a card.
* If an expert player could cleanly *Finesse* a card but instead opts to clue it directly, there must be a good reason.
* If the clue does **not** touch any other new cards, and it is **not** an emergency situation, and it is **not** a mistake, then the player must be trying to communicate something extra.
* In this situation, the player giving the clue intends for the next player to blind-play from the *Finesse Position* that **matches the true *Finesse Position*** of the other card. This is called a *Shadow Finesse* because the positional blind-play is a "shadow" of the card that could have been used for the normal *Finesse*.
* The first card to blind-play is called the *shadow* and the second card to blind-play is called the *shadow target*.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching a single red 1 on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob sees that Alice's clue is very strange: Donald has a red 2 on his slot 4. Alice could have instead clued red to Donald to *Finesse* Cathy's red 1.
  * Bob sees no other explanation for this, so he knows that this must be a *Shadow Finesse* - Bob must hold the red 2's "shadow".
  * Since the red 2 is in Donald's *Fourth Finesse Position* (slot 4), Bob immediately plays his *Fourth Finesse Position* (slot 4). It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  * Cathy can see all of the other hands and understands Alice's clue. Cathy plays the clued red 1.
  * Donald is very surprised to see Bob play his *Forth Finesse Position*. The only thing that could cause this is a *Shadow Finesse*.
  * Donald blind-plays the red 2 (the shadow target) from his slot 4.
* The *shadow* in a *Shadow Finesse* **must** exist in the immediate next player's hand, similar to a *Bluff*. And the player holding the *shadow* **must** blind-play it immediately to resynchronize the team, similar to a *Bluff*.
* Once a *shadow* has been blind-played, the team should consider the *shadow target* as being fully known and "touched". (In other words, it no longer occupies a *Finesse Position*.)
* Remember that *Shadow Finesses* work with *Finesse Positions*, **not** with slot numbers.
* A *Shadow Finesse* is **illegal** if the blind-play could be misinterpreted as some other kind of move. For example:
  * If the *shadow* is on the *First Finesse Position*, then the move might be misinterpreted as a *Bluff* or a *Trash Finesse*.
  * If the *shadow* is on the *Second Finesse Position*, then the move might be misinterpreted as a *5 Color Ejection*
  * If the *shadow* is on the *Third Finesse Position*, then the move might be misinterpreted as an *Unknown Trash Discharge*.
* The *shadow* **must** come before the *shadow target*. In other words, it is **illegal** for Bob to hold the *shadow target*, since he cannot see that a *Shadow Finesse* is occurring (and therefore might try to get the *shadow*).

### The Reverse Shadow Finesse

* *Shadow Finesses* can also be performed in reverse.
* *Reverse Shadow Finesses* are more complicated than normal *Shadow Finesses*, because the person with the clued card has to look ahead to determine whether or not **they** have the *shadow*, or if a **future** player has the *shadow*.
* For an example, in a 4-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Bob, touching a red card on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob knows that his red card must be a red 1.
  * Bob sees that Alice's clue is very strange: Alice could have instead clued red to Donald, touching a red 2 as a *Finesse*.
  * Bob recognizes that Alice must be a *Shadow Finesse*. Bob now must determine where the *shadow* lies.
  * Bob sees that Donald's red 2 is on his *Third Finesse Position*.
  * Bob looks at Cathy's *Third Finesse Position*. If it is playable, then Cathy holds the *shadow*. If it is not playable, then Bob holds the *shadow*.
  * Cathy has a blue 1 in her *Third Finesse Position*, so Bob knows that Cathy holds the *shadow*.
  * Bob plays his clued red 1.
  * Similar to Bob, Cathy also knows that this is a *Shadow Finesse*. Cathy blind-plays her *Third Finesse Position*. It is blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  * Donald is very surprised to see Cathy blind-play her *Third Finesse Position*. The only thing that could cause this is a *Shadow Finesse*.
  * Donald blind-plays the *shadow target* from his *Third Finesse Position*.

## Level 17 - Rarely Used Strategies - Special Bluffs

### Known Bluffs

* Usually, when a *Bluff* occurs, the blind-playing player has no idea that is a *Bluff* - they assume they are playing a specific card into a true *Finesse*.
* However, in rare situations, a clue will be given that looks like a *Finesse*, but the next player will know for sure that they do not have the "matching" card.
* In these situations, if the next player cannot see a better explanation for the clue, then they should blind-play their *Finesse Position* card as a *Known Bluff*.
* For example:
  * The player might see all of the copies of the card that they are supposed to be blind-playing.
  * The player might have negative information on their entire hand (e.g. negative blue on every card when they are supposed to be blind-playing a blue 2).
  * The player might know that they are blind-playing a 1 into a *3 Bluff* (e.g. a card was clued with number 3 and there are no cards played yet).

### Hard Bluffs

* Sometimes, it can be ambiguous as to whether a player blind-played a card into a *Bluff* or a *Finesse* + *Prompt*. In this situation, *Occam's Razor* applies, so players should always opt with the former (simpler) interpretation. When such a *Bluff* occurs, it is called a *Hard Bluff* to disambiguate from situations where *Bluffs* happen with no ambiguity.
* For example, this is a *Finesse* + *Prompt* and **not** a *Hard Bluff*:
  * Only red 1 is played on the stacks.
  * Cathy has a 3 clued in her hand (with no color information on it).
  * Alice clues Cathy about a brand new 4.
  * Bob blind-plays red 2.
  * In a normal *Bluff*, a *one-away-from-playable* card is clued. However, Cathy sees that the highest stack is the red stack, so the 4 in her hand must be two-away.
  * Thus, Cathy does **not** read it as a *Bluff*; she is promised red 3 and red 4, so she plays the unknown 3 as a *Self-Prompt* for the red 3.
* For example, this **is** a *Hard Bluff*:
  * Red 1 and blue 2 are played on the stacks.
  * Cathy has a 3 clued in her hand (with no color information on it).
  * Alice clues Cathy about a brand new 4.
  * Bob blind-plays red 2.
  * This could be a *Bluff* if the 4 in her hand is blue 4, since blue 4 is currently *one-away-from-playable*. Thus, Cathy **does not** assume that her 4 is red 4, and subsequently, does **does not** assume that her unknown 3 is a red 3. However, it could **also** be the case that the 4 is a red 4 (if the 3 in her hand happens to be red 3).
  * Thus, Cathy marks down both possibilities for later and does not play anything right now.

### The Hard 3 Bluff

* Players can use a 3 to *3 Bluff* the 1 of the same suit.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 3 to Cathy, touching a red 3 on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob blind-plays red 1.
  * Bob now knows that it was a *3 Bluff* and that no-one is promised the red 2. This is because even though the red 1 is the same suit as the red 3, *3 Bluffs* take precedence over *Double Finesses* as long as the clue type (number 3) does not match the card that was blind-played (a number 1).

### The Hard 4 Double Bluff

* Similar to a *Hard 3 Bluff*, it is also possible to perform a *Hard 4 Double Bluff*.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * No cards are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 4 to Donald, touching a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob blind-plays red 1 from his *Finesse Position*.
  * Cathy blind-plays red 2 from her *Finesse Position*.
  * Even though red 1 and red 2 are the same suit as the red 4, the team knows that no-one is promised the red 3.

### The Hard 5 Double Bluff

* Similar to a *Hard 3 Bluff* and a *Hard 4 Double Bluff*, it is also possible to perform a *Hard 5 Double Bluff*.
* For example, in a 5-player game:
  * It is the *Mid-Game* and all the 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 5 to Emily, touching a red 5 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob blind-plays a red 2 from his *Finesse Position*.
  * Cathy blind-plays a red 3 from her *Finesse Position*.
  * Donald sees that no-one else has any red cards in their hand. Thus, if this was a *Triple Finesse* on the red 5, then Donald should blind-play the red 4 right now.
  * However, Donald also knows that 5's are valid *Double Bluff* targets. Since number 3 does not match number 5, Donald knows that he should prefer the *Double Bluff* interpretation (that gets two blind-plays) over the *Triple Finesse* interpretation (that gets three blind-plays).

### Stacked Bluffs (Exception)

* Normally, performing a *Bluff* on a player who is already *Finessed* is illegal. This is because players typically play into *Finesses* in order. So, they will ignore the second clue and play into the first *Finesse*, causing any hypothetical *Bluffs* to not resolve immediately. The logic behind this is that the player has to account for the possibility that the first *Finesse* is a *Layered Finesse*.
* Rarely, a player can know that a *Layered Finesse* is impossible. This could be because they know the identity of every card in their hand (minus their *Finesse Position* card). Or, alternatively, they could have relevant negative information on their entire hand.
* If the player can rule out a *Layered Finesse*, then it is possible to perform a *Stacked Bluff* on them. It is important to note that such a player is "locked in" to the *Bluff* and should almost always immediately play their *Finesse Position* card.

### The Known Priority Bluff

* Players generally perform *Priority Bluffs* by tricking players into thinking they have a specific card. However, it is also possible to perform a *Priority Bluff* that is globally-known to be a *Bluff*. For example:
  * Alice has a three known playable cards: red 1, blue 4, and blue 5.
  * Bob has a known red 2.
  * Alice is expected to play the red 1 into the red 2, so the red 1 has *Priority*.
  * Instead, Alice plays the blue 4.
  * Normally, Bob would think that this is a *Priority Finesse* on the blue 5. However, both he and Alice know that Alice has the blue 5.
  * This must be a *Known Priority Bluff*, so Bob plays his *Finesse Position* card as any other playable card.

### The Elimination Bluff & The Elimination Layered Finesse

* It is possible to lie to a player who has *Elimination Notes* on their hand and pretend like you are performing an *Elimination Finesse* on them, causing them to play their oldest card as per the convention. This can cause an unrelated playable card to play.
* If the player who performed the clue was in *Bluff Seat*, then it is to be treated like a *Bluff*, and thus they will not know where the actual *Elimination Card* is. (However, in most cases, at this point there will only be one remaining card with an *Elimination Note* on it, so it won't matter.)
* If the player who performed the clue was not in *Bluff Seat*, then the blind-playing player is expected to keep playing until they find the intended card. This is similar to how a *Layered Finesse* works, but it is inverted such that they play cards from oldest to newest.

### The Out-of-Position Bluff (OOP) / The Reverse Bluff

* Similar to a *Reverse Finesse*, it is possible to perform a *Reverse Bluff*. However, according to *Good Lie Principle*, you are only allowed to lie to the player who comes immediately after you, so this is illegal.
  * Why this policy? It is not possible to play with both *Layered Finesses* and *Reverse Bluffs* at the same time. *Layered Finesses* are much better, so we choose to "turn on" *Layered Finesse* and "turn off" *Reverse Bluffs*.
* However, players **can** rarely break the *Bluff Seat* rule if **one of the following is true**:
  1. The next player is at 0 clues (and won't blind-play anything / will blind-play an unrelated card).
  2. The next player will think that they have the *Bluffed* card in their own hand and will not try to *Finesse* or *Bluff* the next player. (In this case, the *Bluffed* card means the card that will blind-play.)
  3. The next player has enough positive or negative clues on their entire hand to know that they cannot have the card that the blind-played card will be played as.
* Essentially, if i. or ii. is true, then the next player cannot act on their state of misinformation. And if iii. is true, then the next player will have full knowledge that a lie is occurring, so they will not try to "get" the *Bluffed* card.
* Since valid *Out-of-Position Bluffs* are so rare, it is important to remember that:
  * Valid *Out-of-Position Bluffs* take precedence over *Known Bluffs*. In other words, if Bob can see that an *OOP Bluff* could be valid (meaning it meets one of the three criteria above), then Bob should not blind-play anything as a *Known Bluff* and let Cathy play instead.
  * Valid *Out-of-Position Bluffs* take precedence over *Layered Finesses*. In other words, if Cathy can see that an *OOP Bluff* could be valid (meaning it meets one of the three criteria above), then Cathy should not continue to blind-play cards as a *Layered Finesse*. (This is a common mistake.)
* A *Reverse Bluff* is just a just a more-specific type of *Out-of-Position Bluff*. All of the same stipulations apply.

### The Good Touch Bluff

* Care has to be taken so that a *Bluff* does not look like a *Finesse*. For example, in a 4-player game:
  * Red 2 and blue 2 are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Cathy number 4, which touches a red 4.
  * Bob blind-plays a blue 3 from his *Finesse Position*.
  * Since 3 matches 4, Cathy knows she has the blue 4, and goes on to misplay red 4 as blue 4.
  * Thus, Alice should not have given this clue.
* However, what if someone else on the team already has the matching card? In this situation, the clue can be given without fear: from *Good Touch Principle*, the clue recipient will know that it is a *Bluff* instead of a *Finesse*.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * Red 2 and blue 2 are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues Cathy number 4, which touches a red 4.
  * Bob blind-plays a blue 3 from his *Finesse Position*.
  * Cathy's first thought is that since 3 matches 4, she must have the blue 4. However, Cathy sees that Donald already has a clued blue 4 it in his hand. (The blue 4 just has a blue clue on it and the true identity of the card is not yet known to Donald.)
  * Cathy knows that she must **not** have the blue 4, because then Alice's clue would have violated *Good Touch Principle*. Cathy can reason that her 4 is instead some **other** *one-away-from-playable* 4. The only other valid *Bluff* target is the red 4 (because the only *one-away-from-playable* 4 is red 4). So, Cathy marks her card as red 4 as discards.
  * Donald is surprised by Alice's clue. From Donald's perspective, Cathy should have misplayed the red 4 as the blue 4, since 3 matches 4.
  * Since Cathy did not misplay, Donald can reason that **he** must have the blue 4. Donald marks the previously unknown blue card in his hand as blue 4.

### The Pestilent Double Bluff

* In the *Good Touch Bluff*, a *Bluff* is given that looks like a *Finesse*. However, what if something that looks like a *Good Touch Bluff* is done, but the "matching" card is not yet clued?
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice goes first.
  * Bob has a red 1 on slot 1 and a blue 2 on slot 2.
  * Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching a blue 2 on slot 2.
  * Bob does not see any other 1's on *Finesse Position*. Thus, the number 2 clue must be a *Self-Finesse*, so he blind-plays red 1.
  * Cathy comes next. From her perspective, Bob should currently think that his slot 2 card is red 2 (instead of blue 2). If nothing else happens, Bob will go on to misplay that card.
  * Cathy knows that technically, she could give a *Fix Clue* to Bob to fix the situation. However, is that what Alice really intended? That would be waste a clue and would be really inefficient. Alice must be trying to communicate something extra.
* In almost all cases, Cathy should blind-play her *Finesse Position* card as the red 2. Doing so would "heal" the situation, since Bob would no longer think he has the red 2.
* Furthermore, Cathy could also be blind-playing **any** playable card. Even if it is not the red 2, blind-playing any card would equally "heal" the situation, because Bob would know that Cathy is blind-playing from the same clue.
* This is a kind of *Double Bluff*, since it gets two people in a row to blind-play their *Finesse Position*, getting two unrelated cards. However, unlike a normal *Double Bluff*, a *Pestilent Double Bluff* is initiated by cluing a *one-away-from-playable* card (instead of a two-or-more-away-from-playable card).
* Additionally, consider the case where Cathy sees one red 2 of someone else's hand (e.g. Donald's hand). In this hypothetical, Cathy could just give a *Play Clue* to the red 2 in Donald's hand, Donald would play the card, and that would "heal" the situation, because Bob would no longer think that he has the red 2. However, we agree that Cathy should **not** do this and should **still** blind-play her *Finesse Position* card. (This is because doing something weird like this for a 3-for-2 is not strong enough.)
* Additionally, consider the case where Cathy sees **both** copies of red 2 in someone else's hand (e.g. Donald's hand). In this hypothetical, Bob would not go on to misplay the red 2, so no further action is needed to heal the situation. However, we agree that Cathy should **still** blind-play her *Finesse Position* card (as a *Known Pestilent Double Bluff*). (This is because seeing both copies is so rare that we do not want complicate things by having to consider it.)
* More examples of a *Pestilent Double Bluff* can be found [here](examples/Pestilent_Double_Bluff.md).

### The Pestilent Triple Bluff

* First, see the section on the *[Pestilent Double Bluff](#pestilent-double-bluff)*.
* Rarely, it is possible that a *Pestilent*-style clues is performed with a two-away-from-playable card instead of a *one-away-from-playable* card. In this situation, it would transform into a *Triple Bluff* instead of a *Double Bluff*.
* Note that normally, *Triple Bluffs* are explicitly illegal. But *Pestilent Triple Bluffs* are an exception to this rule.
* For example, in a 5-player game:
  * All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 4 to Emily, touching a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob attempts to blind-play a red 2 from his *Finesse Position*. Instead, it is a blue 2, and it successfully plays.
  * Cathy knows that this is probably a *4's Double Bluff*. Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* as any playable card. It is a blue 3 and it successfully plays.
  * Donald knows that Emily will go on to incorrectly think that her red 4 is a blue 4 (because Alice's clue looks like a *Double Finesse*). Thus, Alice's clue is quite strange.
  * Alice must be intending for Donald to also blind-play his *Finesse Position* in order to "heal" the problem. Donald blind-plays his *Finesse Position*. It is a green 2 and it successfully plays.
  * At first, Emily thought that her 4 was the blue 4, in order to match the blue 2 and the blue 3. However, if that was the case, then Donald would not have blind-played anything. Emily knows that this must be a *Pestilent Triple Bluff*, and her 4 is any other 4 than blue 4 (because Donald blind-played) and green 4 (because Bob would have waited for Donald).

### The Pass Bluff

* First, see the section on the *[Hesitation Blind-Play](#the-hesitation-blind-play)*.
* It is possible for a *Hesitation Blind-Play* to occur without anyone intending it to happen. However, if a player intentionally tries to make a *Hesitation Blind-Play* occur, it is called a *Pass Bluff*.
* In other words, after a *Finesse* occurs that is directed at you, you will know that your *Finesse Position* card is playable. If the next immediate player also has an unrelated playable card on their *Finesse Position*, you can pretend like the *Finesse* wasn't directed at you. This will cause them to think that the *Finesse* was directed at them, and you will get the unrelated card played for free.
* After the unrelated card is played, the next player should **not** continue to blind-play cards (as a *Layered Finesse*) because:
  * The "passing" player fulfills the real *Finesse* on their next turn.
  * The "passing" player was in *Bluff Seat*.
* *Pass Bluffs* rely on contextual information in order to work, so the circumstances in which you can do them are narrow.
* It is illegal for a player to perform a *Pass Bluff* if they could be *Bluffed*. (This is because the first *Bluff* would not resolve immediately and would violate *Good Lie Principle*.)
  * Subsequently, it is also illegal for a player to pass an *Ejection* to the next player.

### The Double/Triple Pass Bluff

* After a player performs a *Pass Bluff*, when it becomes their turn again, if they see an unrelated playable card on the *Second Finesse Position* of the next player, they can perform yet another *Pass Bluff*, implying that the first *Pass Bluff* was not a *Pass Bluff* at all and instead simply a *Layered Finesse* or *Clandestine Finesse*.
* Then, after the unrelated card is played, the player who initiated the *Double Pass Bluff* can go ahead and play into the real *Finesse*.
* Alternatively, if there continue to be playable cards, they can keep *Pass Bluffing*.

### The Purge Bluff (Layered Bluff)

* This convention only applies to 3-player games.
* Sometimes, a player will have a fully playable hand from left to right. In this situation, players will normally try to perform a *Layered Finesse* in order to get all of the cards in the most efficient manner. However, a *Layered Finesse* may not always be available.
* In extremely rare situations, it is possible to orchestrate a lie in which the player with the fully playable hand thinks that they are *Layered Finessed* when they really do not have the connecting card. After they play their final card and it is not the matching card, they will know that they were *Purge Bluffed* and that nobody has the missing card.
* Care has to be taken that the other player (e.g. the player who is not *Purge Bluffed*) will understand what is going on. For example, they might think that a *Patch Finesse* is happening. Thus, *Purge Bluffs* can only be done in expert games where there is **no other possible interpretation for what is happening**.
* If the player blind-playing cards into a *Purge Bluff* realizes that a lie has occurred before they finish blind-playing their entire hand, they are supposed to stop. In other words, they are **not** supposed to continue blind-playing cards as a *Known Purge Bluff*.
* Examples of a *Purge Bluff* can be found [here](examples/Purge_Bluff.md).

## Level 17 - Rarely Used Strategies - Special Suboptimal Moves

* The following *Finesses* or *Bluffs* are triggered by performing a suboptimal clue or by picking a strange choice for a clue.

### The Suboptimal Save Prompt & The Suboptimal Save Finesse & The Suboptimal Save Bluff

* If the other copy of a card is in the trash already, then the remaining copy needs to be saved. These cards are allowed to be saved with either a color clue or a number clue.
* If both types of clues will **only** introduce one new card, then it is said that that there is a *Free Choice* between the two clue types.
* In this situation, the clue type will be chosen that "fills in" other ancillary cards in the hand or gives important negative information.
* If a clue type is chosen that is clearly worse than the other one, then the clue giver must be trying to communicate something extra.
* The means that this innocent-looking *Save Clue* is really a *Play Clue*, and all of the in-between cards are called for.

### The Declined 5's Finesse

* The *5's Chop Move* is typically used to save a 5 and a critical non-5 at the same time. This is very efficient, because it saves both cards with one clue instead of having to spend two clues.
* So, when a player has this strategy available, but instead declines to do it and clues the critical card on chop directly (without touching any other cards), then this is quite strange.
* In this situation, the player must be trying to communicate something extra. Similar to an *Occupied Finesse*, the player is trying to signal that this seemingly innocent *Save Clue* is actually a *Play Clue* instead. Someone on the team must have the cards to make this critical card playable.
* In some situations, the blind-player may have to defer playing into the *Finesse* and instead give a *5 Save* to the player with the (now) unsafe chop. If they do, then this is not a problem - the clue receiver can retroactively determine that a *Declined 5's Finesse* has occurred and should not *stomp* on the *Finesse*.

### The Rank Choice Bluff

* *Reverse Finesses* take precedence over *Bluffs*. This means that players cannot use cards to *Bluff* when there are "matching" cards on other player's *Finesse Positions*.
* However, in some rare situations, when initiating a *Reverse Finesse*, players have a free choice between a color clue and a rank clue, meaning that both rank and color will **only** touch the one target card. Here, players will normally choose color instead of rank, since in most variants, color clues are better than rank clues.
* In this situation, if a player chooses rank instead of color, and there was not a good reason to do so, then the player giving the clue must be trying to communicate something extra - that they really want a *Bluff* to happen (instead of a *Reverse Finesse*). This is called a *Rank Choice Bluff*.
* It is possible to use the *Rank Choice* convention with any kind of *Bluff*. Thus, it is possible to *Rank Choice 3 Bluff*, *Rank Choice Double Bluff*, and so forth.
* Examples:
  * [Game #8129, turn 4](https://hanab.live/replay/8129/4) if Zamiel clues Hyakinthus' green 3 with number 3

### The Rank Choice Finesse

* First, see the section on the *[Rank Choice Bluff](#the-rank-choice-bluff)*.
* After Bob sees that Alice wants a *Rank Choice Bluff* to happen, he will blind-play his *Finesse Position* card, expecting it to be an unrelated card. But what if Bob plays a card that matches the card that was clued?
* In this situation, it would be a *Rank Choice Finesse* instead of a *Rank Choice Bluff*. A *Rank Choice Finesse* may be preferable to a (more ordinary) *Ambiguous Finesse*, which will resolve more slowly.

### The Rank Choice Save Finesse

* When saving a card, players have to choose carefully between using a color clue or a rank clue. However, in some rare situations, it makes absolutely no difference which clue is used:
  * Both color and rank would only touch the specific card.
  * Both color and rank would communicate the exact identity of the specific card.
  * Both color and rank would not give any useful negative information to the other cards in the hand.
* In these situations, the player giving the clue has a completely free choice between rank and color. We agree that by default, players should use color to save the card.
* If players instead use a rank clue to save the card, this communicates a *Rank Choice Save Finesse*. (This is similar to the more-ordinary *Rank Choice Finesse*, except it is initiated with a *Save Clue* instead of a *Play Clue*).

<br />

## Level 17 - Rarely Used Strategies - Pushes & Pulls

### The Trash Push Prompt & The Trash Push Finesse

* If a player performs a *Trash Push* on a *one-away-from-playable* card, it is a signal that someone else has the connecting card as a *Prompt* or a *Finesse*.

### The Trash Pull

* Sometimes, towards the end of the game, there can be a playable card in the middle of someone's hand that is not cluable directly due to the presence of other blocking cards.
* In this situation, players often resort to a *Trash Push* in order to "get" the card without cluing it directly. However, this will obviously only work if the player has a trash card on their chop, which may not always be the case.
* Another tool to "get" a card in the middle of a hand is by doing the opposite of a *Trash Push* - a *Trash Pull*.
* If an off-chop trash card is clued, this would typically be interpreted as a *Trash Chop Move*. However, towards the end of the game, a *Chop Move* would be pointless, as there are no cards left to chop move. Thus, the player should know that it is a *Trash Pull* instead of a *Trash Chop Move*, and should blind-play the card to the right of the trash.
* Just like how a *5 Pull* can only be done in the *Early Game*, a *Trash Pull* can only be done at the end of the game.
* Since players often perform *Burn* clues for stalling purposes in the *End-Game*, care has to be taken to not confuse a normal *Burn* clue with a *Trash Pull*. This is especially true if there was nothing else obvious for the clue giver to do!
* *Trash Pulls* should typically be used as a last-resort since they might be misinterpreted.

### The 5 Double Pull (Or The Double 5 Pull)

* This convention only applies in the *Early Game*.
* Normally, in the *Early Game*, it is impossible to perform a *5 Pull* on a chop card, because it will instead be interpreted as an *Early 5's Chop Move*. In this situation, players will almost always just give a direct *Chop-Focus Play Clue* (and then give a *5 Save* to the 5 later on).
* However, what if a player performs an *Early 5's Chop Move* on a playable card instead of just giving a *Chop-Focus Play Clue*? They must be trying to communicate something extra.
* In this situation, they are really trying to perform a *5 Double Pull*, which pulls a card from the next player and also pulls a card from the player who received the number 5 clue. The next player should blind-play their *Finesse Position* card, which gives the clue receiver enough information to know that the move was really a *5 Pull* after all.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Cathy's hand is, from newest to oldest: blue 4, blue 4, blue 5, red 1
  * Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, touching a blue 5 on slot 3.
  * It is now Bob's turn. Bob sees that since there were other *Play Clues* for Alice to give, Cathy will interpret this as an *Early 5's Chop Move*.
  * Bob also knows that it is nonsensical to *Chop Move* a playable red 1 - Alice could have just give a red *Chop Focus Play Clue* to the red 1.
  * Thus, this must be a *5 Double Pull*, so Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  * Cathy knows that if this was an *Early 5's Chop Move*, then Bob would not have blind-played anything. Since he blind-played his *Finesse Position* card, this must be a *5 Double Pull*. Cathy blind-plays her slot 4 card (the card to the right of the clued 5).
* More examples of a *5 Double Pull* can be found [here](examples/5_Double_Pull.md).

<br />

## Level 17 - Rarely Used Strategies - Ejection

* *Ejection* refers to a move like a *Bluff*, but instead of playing an unrelated card from *Finesse Position*, someone plays an unrelated card from their *Second Finesse Position*. For example, if a player's hand is completely unclued, their *Second Finesse Position* is slot 2.
* Just like a *Bluff*, an *Ejection* can only be performed on the very next player.

### The 5 Color Ejection

* The *5 Color Ejection* is covered in [level 12](#the-5-color-ejection-5ce).

### Double Play Ejection

* If a player knows that a card in their hand is playable, and then they receive **another** clue on that card, it is usually a *Fix Clue*, which means that the card is actually bad and they should discard it instead of playing it.
* However, if this happens on a good card, the other players can see that the clue must have some other purpose - it should signal an *Ejection* on the very next player.

### Bad Chop Move Ejection (with a Trash Chop Move)

* Normally, when known trash is touched as the focus of the clue, and the known trash is not on chop, it communicates a *Trash Chop Move*.
* However, what if the *Chop Moved* cards are also all trash? The other players can see that this clue must have some other purpose.
* In this situation, it should signal an *Ejection* on the very next player.
* *Bad Chop Move Ejection* can be performed throughout the game. (But keep in mind that in the *End-Game*, a player might just be stalling.)

### Bad Chop Move Ejection (with 5's)

* First, see the section on *[Bad Chop Move Ejection (with a Trash Chop Move)](bad-chop-move-ejection-with-a-trash-chop-move)*.
* Normally, if a player performs a *5's Chop Move* on a trash card, it would signal a *Finesse* on all of the cards leading up to the 5.
* If the very next player sees that **they will only have to blind-play one card in their hand to fulfill the *Finesse***, then they should assume that it is a *Finesse*.
* If the very next player sees that they would have to blind-play two or more cards in their hand to fulfill the *Finesse*, then a *Finesse* is unlikely. Instead, players agree that this signals an *Ejection* and that the next player should play their *Second Finesse Position*.
* After the *Ejection*, the player receiving the 5 clue will knows that they have trash on their chop.
* For example, in a 5-player game:
  * It is the *Mid-Game* and all of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, touching a blue 5 on slot 3.
  * Cathy's slot 4 card is a red 1. (This was her chop prior to the number 5 clue being given.)
  * It is now Bob's turn. Bob knows that since Alice number 5 clue kind of looks like a *5's Chop Move*, since the 5 is exactly one-away-from-chop. However, since it would be *Chop Moving* a trash card, it can't be that.
  * Bob next assumes that this is simply a *Play Clue* on the blue 5. That would mean that someone has the blue 3 and the blue 4.
  * Bob's hand is completely unclued. Furthermore, Bob does not see the blue 3 or the blue 4 anywhere else, so he would have to have both of them in his hand. Bob knows that similar to a *5 Color Ejection*, a *Bad Chop Move Ejection* should take precedence if he is supposed to play two or more blind cards.
  * Thus, Bob blind-plays his *Second Finesse Position*. It is a green 1 and successfully plays.
  * Cathy knows that if this was an *5's Chop Move*, then Bob would not have blind-played anything. If it was a *Finesse*, then Bob would have blind-played his *Finesse Position*. Since he blind-played his *Second Finesse Position* card, this must be a *Bad Chop Move Ejection* and her slot 4 card must be trash.

### Rank Choice Ejection (with a number 2 or a number 5)

* Typically, when a number 2 clue or a number 5 clue is performed on a chop card, it will be treated as a *2 Save* or a *5 Save* and the card will not play.
* If a player performs a *2 Save* or a *5 Save* on a playable card and they could have easily used a normal color *Play Clue*, this is quite strange. They must be trying to communicate something extra.
* In this situation, they intend for an *Ejection* on the very next player.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  * Cathy's hand is completely unclued and is, from newest to oldest: blue 3, blue 3, blue 4, blue 4, red 2
  * Alice clues number 2 to Cathy, touching the red 2 as a *2 Save*.
  * Bob sees that the obvious clue to give to Cathy was red, as it would actually get the red 2 played right now.
  * This move is so bad that it must be communicating something extra. Alice must be intending for a *Rank Choice Ejection*. Bob blind-plays his *Second Finesse Position* card and it is a blue 1 and successfully plays.
  * Cathy knows that since a number 2 clue cause Bob to blind-play his *Second Finesse Position*, this must be an *Ejection*. The only type of *Ejection* that matches this kind of clue is a *Rank Choice Ejection*, so Cathy knows that her 2 must be playable and that her 2 must be exactly the red 2. Cathy plays the red 2.

<br />

## Level 17 - Rarely Used Strategies - Discharge

* *Discharge* is similar to *Ejection*, except instead of blind-playing the *Second Finesse Position* card, the player plays the *Third Finesse Position* card.
* Just like a *Bluff*, a *Discharge* can only be performed on the very next player.

### The Unknown Trash Discharge

* The *Unknown Trash Discharge* is introduced in [level 15](#the-unknown-trash-discharge-utd).

### 5 Number Discharge (5ND)

* This convention only applies in the *Early Game*.
* In the *Early Game*, if a number 5 clue is performed on a 5 that is not already on chop, then the clue is a *5 Stall*.
* If a *5 Stall* is not allowed, then it is a *5's Chop Move* (if the card is one-away-from-chop) or a *5 Pull* (if the card is two or more away from chop).
* If a *5 Pull* is performed on a card that is *one-away-from-playable*, it typically communicates a *5 Pull Finesse*.
* However, if the *5 Pulled* card is two or more away from playable **or** the *5 Pulled* card is trash, players agree that this signals a *Discharge* and that the next player should play their *Third Finesse Position*.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, touching a 5 on slot 1.
  * Cathy hand is, from newest to oldest: red 5, red 3, green 2, green 1, green 2
  * Bob thinks about what Alice's 5 clue could mean:
    * The clue cannot be a *5 Stall*, because there is a green 1 to *Play Clue*.
    * The clue cannot be a *5 Pull*, because the red 3 is two away from playable.
  * Since Bob would have to blind-play two cards into the *Finesse*, he knows that he should instead treat this as a *5 Number Discharge*. Bob blind-plays his slot 3 card and it successfully plays as the red 1.
* More examples of a *5 Number Discharge* can be found [here](examples/5_Number_Discharge.md).

### Trash Push Discharge

* Normally, when known trash is touched as the focus of the clue, and the known trash is on chop, it communicates a *Trash Push*.
* However, what if the *Trash Pushed* card is trash? The other players can see that this clue must have some other purpose - it should signal an *Discharge* on the very next player.
* This move is extremely similar to the *Unknown Trash Discharge*. In UTD, the focus of the clue is promised as trash. In the *Trash Push Discharge*, the *Trash Pushed* card is promised as trash.

<br />

## Level 17 - Rarely Used Strategies - Ejection & Discharge Extensions

### The Out-of-Position Ejection

* Normally, players are only allowed to perform an *Ejection* on the very next player (similar to a *Bluff*).
* However, if an *Ejection* is performed, and the very next player does not have a *Second Finesse Position*, then they cannot demonstrate to the team that an *Ejection* is occurring.
* In this situation, the *Ejection* is on the next player with a *Second Finesse Position*. The player being passed over knows that the next player will blind-play, so they can either discard or give an unrelated clue. After that, the next player should blind-play their card immediately to demonstrate what is going on.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * All of the 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Bob's has three 5's in his hand in slot 2, slot 3, and slot 4. (They were clued with number 5 as a *5 Save* earlier on in the game.)
  * Alice clues red to Donald, touching a red 5 on his slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob does not see any connecting red cards in anybody's hand. Since the red 5 is three-away-from-playable, Bob knows that this must be a *5 Color Ejection*.
  * However, Bob does not have a *Second Finesse Position*. (He only has one unclued card in his hand.)
  * Thus, Bob knows that this is an *Out-of-Position 5 Color Ejection* on Cathy.
  * Bob discards.
  * Cathy blind-plays her *Second Finesse Position* and it successfully plays as red 2.
  * Donald knows that since Cathy blind-played her *Second Finesse Position* card, this must be a *5 Color Ejection* and that his red card is the red 5.
* Note that you are not allowed to perform *Out-of-Position Ejections* in reverse, unless it is super-obvious what is going on.
* Remember that just because *OOP Ejections* are technically legal in some situations, this does **not** mean that players should use them. Just like any other complicated move, only use *OOP Ejections* when it is super-clear to the rest of the team what is going on. Otherwise, a simpler line should be chosen.

### The Out-of-Position Discharge

* First, see the section on *[Out-of-Position Ejection](#the-out-of-position-ejection)*.
* Just like OOP *Ejection*, it is possible to do OOP *Discharge* in the exact same way.

### The Stacked Ejection

* Normally, you are not allowed to perform a *Bluff* on a player that is already "loaded" with a blind-play for a *Finesse*. (This is because the next player will allow for the possibility of a *Layered Finesse*, and the *Bluff* will not resolve immediately.)
* Similarly, since *Ejections* follow most of the same rules as *Bluffs*, you are not allowed to perform an *Ejection* on a player that is already "loaded" with a blind-play for a *Finesse*.
* So, if a 5 was clued with color in this situation, the next player would assume a *Stacked Finesse* instead of a *5 Color Ejection*. Thus, they would then play the card from the original *Finesse* (or play nothing if the card from the original *Finesse* is not yet playable).
* However, what if the next player can know that a *Stacked Finesse* is impossible due to them not having enough possible cards to fulfill the *Finesse*? In this case, it would be a *Known Stacked 5 Color Ejection*.
* When this occurs, players should immediately play their *First Finesse Position* (slot 2) instead of their *Second Finesse* position (slot 3).
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * Nothing is played on the stacks and it is the first turn of the game.
  * Alice clues red to Donald, touching a red 2. This is a *Finesse* on Cathy's red 1 (in her slot 1).
  * Bob clues blue to Donald, touching a blue 5.
  * Now, it is Cathy's turn. Cathy knows that she has a playable red 1, since no-one else on the team has a red 1.
  * Additionally, Cathy might think that Bob's clue was a *Stacked Finesse* on the blue 5. However, this is impossible, because Cathy sees that no-one else on the team has any blue cards. Thus, for a *Stacked Finesse* to be the case, Cathy would have to have red 1, blue 1, blue 2, blue 3, and blue 4, and Cathy only has 4 cards in her hand (since it is a 4-player game).
  * Since a *Stacked Finesse* is impossible, Cathy knows that this must be a *Stacked 5 Color Ejection*.
  * Alice's clue *Finessed* Cathy. So after Alice's clue, Cathy's *Finesse Position* moved to her slot 2 and her *Second Finesse Position* moved to her slot 3.
  * Normally, *Ejection* calls for the *Second Finesse Position*, but in this case, Cathy knows that *Stacked 5 Color Ejections* call for the *First Finesse Position* instead of the *Second Finesse Position*, so Cathy blind-plays slot 2 (instead of slot 3).

### The Stacked Discharge

* First, see the section on *[Stacked Ejection](#the-stacked-ejection)*.
* Just like *Stacked Ejection*, it is possible to do *Stacked Discharge* in the exact same way.

<br />

## Level 17 - Rarely Used Strategies - Ignition

### Ignition

* An *Ignition* is a type of move that makes someone blind-play a card from their *Finesse Position*.
* An *Ignition* is different from a *Finesse* and a *Bluff* because the blind-play from an *Ignition* is:
  * unrelated to the clue that was given
    * e.g. It doesn't "match", which is unlike a *Finesse*, but like a *Bluff*.
  * unrelated to the *playability* of the clued card
    * e.g. Nothing needs to be "proved" to the player who got clued, which is unlike a *Finesse*, and unlike a *Bluff*.
* Currently, there is only one type of clue that can cause an *Ignition*; see below.

### Double Ignition (with Known Trash)

* Towards the end of the game, if a player clues known trash, then there are usually 3 possible interpretations:

#### 1) A Late-Game Trash Chop Move

* Sometimes, players perform a *Trash Chop Move* by cluing known trash in another player's hand (off-chop).
* However, players can know that *Trash Chop Move* is impossible if:
  * they are not the clue-receiver and they can see that the *Chop Moved* card is bad
  * they are the clue-receiver and they can determine that they are no cards left to *Chop Move* (meaning that all of the cards are accounted for, or all of the remaining cards could be given a direct *Play Clue* or a direct *Save Clue*).

#### 2) A Late-Game *Trash Push* (or a *Trash Push Finesse*)

* Sometimes, players perform a *Trash Push* (or a *Trash Push Finesse*) by cluing known trash in another player's hand (on-chop).
* However, players can know that a *Trash Push* is impossible if:
  * they are not the clue-receiver and they can see that the "pushed" card is bad
  * they are the clue-receiver and they can determine that they are no more cards left to *Trash Push*

#### 3) A Late-Game Burn Clue

* Sometimes, players give meaningless *Burn Clues* to known trash cards in order to avoid drawing more cards. (This is rare, because they would normally re-clue a playable card, but sometimes it is done.)
* However, players can know that a *Burn Clue* is impossible if they see that a normal *Play Clue* could have been given instead.

#### A Double Ignition

* If the known trash clue cannot be any of these 3 things, then it communicates a *Double Ignition*, meaning that the next two players should blind-play their *Finesse Position* card.
* For the players playing into a *Double Ignition*, it is pretty easy to see what is going on, because they can see the playable *Finesse Position* card of the other person.

#### Conflict with Bad Chop Move Ejection

* Technically, cluing a known trash card to *Chop Move* a "bad" card would trigger an *Ejection* (as a *Bad Trash Chop Move Ejection*).
* In this situation, players should always assume a *Double Ignition* over a *Bad Trash Chop Move Ejection* (since the latter is very rare).

## Level 17 - Rarely Used Strategies - Save Clues & Non-Emergency Chop Moves

### 2 Saves (Off Chop on the First Turn)

* On the first turn of the game, it is not possible to discard. If there is absolutely nothing else to do, it is permissible in this situation to use a number 2 clue to save a 2 that is **not** on chop, but only if the other players can see that you had no other choice.
* This situation typically only happens in 3-player games.

### 2 Saves (Advanced Section; Interaction With 5's Chop Moves / 5 Pulls)

* Normally, in the *Early Game*, if a player performs a number 5 clue on an off-chop 5 and there are other things to do, this is normally a *5's Chop Move* or a *5 Pull*.
* However, to the person receiving the number 5 clue, what if the only thing left to do is a *2 Save* on someone's chop? Note that *2 Saves* are not required on 2's that are visible in other people's hands. If the person receiving the number 5 clue has the other copy of the 2 in their hand, then the 5 clue would just be a normal *5 Stall*.
* In this situation, the player is expected to mark *Elimination Notes* on their hand for the other copy of the 2. Furthermore, they are not allowed to save the other copy of the 2, so they must give some other clue or discard.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 5 to Bob, touching a 5 on slot 1.
  * From Bob's perspective, he does not see any other *Play Clues* or *Save Clues* that Alice could have given, with the exception of a *2 Save* on a red 2 on Cathy's chop.
  * Thus, Alice's number 5 clue could be either a *5 Pull* or a *5 Stall*, depending on whether or not Bob has the other copy of the red 2 in his hand.
  * Bob knows that in this situation, *5 Stalls* take precedence over *5 Pulls*, so he marks his hand for the other copy of red 2 and discards.

### 2 Saves (Advanced Section; Interaction With Double Chop 2's and 5 Stalls)

* Normally, players are only allowed to perform a *5 Stall* in the *Early Game* (or another valid stalling situation) only if there is no normal *Save Clues* to give.
* However, what if the same 2 is on the chop of two different players?
  * Normally, when two different players have the same 2, no-one is required to give a *Save Clue* to the first one.
  * But when *both* of the 2's are on chop, the team has to choose to save one of them and they can choose whichever player that they want.
* Subsequently, it is **illegal** for someone to perform a *5 Stall* if both copies of the same 2 are both on the chop of two different players. They must instead choose to save one of the 2's.

### Saving Playable Cards when the Preceding Cards Are Not Promptable

* Often times, a player will have two similar clued cards in their hand with the left-most being unplayable and the right-most being playable. In this situation, the other members of the team cannot use a *Prompt* to "get" the cards, since the left-most would misplay.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  * Earlier on in the game, Bob was given a *2 Save* clue. Now, he has a playable red 2 on his slot 5 and an unplayable blue 2 on his slot 4.
  * Cathy has a red 3 on her chop.
  * If Alice clued the red 3 in Cathy's hand, Bob would be *Prompted* for slot 4, and blue 2 would misplay.
* In this example, Cathy's red 3 is in danger of being discarded soon, so Alice is in a rough spot. From *Save Principle*, Alice is expected to not let the playable red 3 get discarded. But cluing the red 3 would cause Bob to misplay the valuable blue 2.
* Players in this kind of situation will generally solve it in two ways:

#### A Tempo Clue + A Play Clue

* Two players can work together. One player can give a *Tempo Clue* to the unpromptable card, and the other player can give a *Play Clue* to the next card.
* Alternatively, one player can give a *Tempo Clue* to the unpromptable card and assume that the player with the next card will give some clue. Later on, someone can clue the next card.

#### A Play Clue + A Fix Clue

* If the next player will not immediately misplay, then sometimes you can give the *Play Clue* to the next card first.
* The other players on the team are expected to realize what is going on and help out by immediately giving a *Fix Clue* to the *Prompted* player before they misplay.

### Spillover Chop Move

* If an *Order Chop Move* or a *Trash Order Chop Move* is performed, but the player who is supposed to *Chop Move* already has every single card in their hand clued, then this is very strange.
* In this situation, the *Chop Move* should "skip" over that player and *Chop Move* the next person after that.

### The Chop Transfer

* Sometimes, duplicated cards are accidentally *Chop Moved* through a mistake or through a complicated situation. When this happens, it is pointless to use a clue to "undo" the *Chop Move* - the team can just continue to allow the player to discard normally.
* Subsequently, if someone **does** use a clue to undo the *Chop Move*, there must be a good reason. This means that the card they were about to discard is important, so the player should discard the now-known useless card and then permanently *Chop Move* their new chop.

<br />

## Level 17 - Rarely Used Strategies - Emergency Moves

### The Fake Save

* We are only able to perform *Save Clues* on specific cards and in specific ways, as outlined in the Beginner's Guide. For example, we all agree that we must save 5's with number 5.
* In some specific circumstances, the team will have only one clue available and multiple cards must be saved with a single clue. In this situation, to prevent losing the game (or losing a currently-playable card), it is permissible to "lie" to the player and perform a non-legal *Save Clue*. The player will mark their chop card as something other than what it really is, so this move commits the team to giving a *Fix Clue* at some point in the future.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Alice has 1 clue available.
  * Bob has a red 5 on chop, followed by a red 4. The other copy of the red 4 is in the discard pile, so there are two critical cards in a row.
  * Alice is not allowed to save the red 5 with a red clue, because then it would look like a *Save Clue* on a red 4.
  * However, if Alice clues number 5 to Bob, then he will discard the red 4.
  * Thus, Alice performs a *Fake Save* on both red cards by cluing red.
  * Bob will mark his chop as the red 4, so the team will have to give him a number 5 clue as a *Fix Clue* at some point in the future. At that point, Bob will be surprised, but he will be able to retroactively see that Alice was in a very tight spot and had to give a *Fake Save*.
* Note that normally, *Fake Saves* are **only allowed as a last resort**. If there is some other line that would "work" or be safe without a *Fake Save*, then players have to prefer that. Subsequently, *Fake Saves* are extremely rare.

### The Sacrifice Discard

* It is generally undesirable for a player to have a "fully locked" hand, but sometimes it happens. And sometimes, one card in the locked hand is useful in the future, but not critical (meaning there is another copy of the card in someone else's hand or still in the deck).
* Normally, you are never supposed to discard cards that have clues on them, as if you do, it implies a *Sarcastic Discard* or a *Gentleman's Discard*. However, in this situation, the player who is locked can choose to "sacrifice" one of the cards in their hand that is non-critical. And in this situation, it does **not** imply a *Sarcastic Discard* or a *Gentleman's Discard*.

### The Unnecessary Generation Discard

* Sometimes, in order to satisfy *Save Principle*, a player will perform an unnecessary *Generation Discard*, which generates a clue to save a card that they actually already have in their hand.
* This puts the next player in an ambiguous situation: was it really a *Generation Discard*, or could it a *Scream Discard*? In order to cover both situations, they should not *Chop Move*, but they should also not discard on this turn.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Red 3 is played on the stacks. No blue cards are played on the stacks.
  * Alice has a blue 1 in her hand. She knows the exact identity of it, so it is known playable.
  * Alice also has a 4 clued in her hand. She does not know what color it is.
  * There are 0 clues, so if Alice plays the blue 1, Bob will be forced to discard.
  * Alice sees that Cathy has a red 4 on chop, which is playable. If Alice does not have red 4 in her hand, then Cathy could potentially discard the red 4 (after Bob is forced to discard).
  * So, Alice performs a *Generation Discard* to generate a clue so that Bob can clue the get the red 4, if necessary.
  * Bob sees that Alice does indeed already have the red 4 in her hand, so from his perspective, if Alice was performing a *Generation Discard*, it was unnecessary.
  * However, it could also be the case that Bob's chop is unsafe. So, Bob will **not** clue the red 4 on Cathy's chop, but he **will** spend the clue in some other productive fashion. If Bob has nothing productive to do, he must "burn" a clue, similar to what happens when a *Scream Discard* occurs.

### The Shout Discard Chop Move

* Normally, when a player performs a *Scream Discard*, they are discarding their chop (e.g. an unknown and unclued card).
* However, if a player has both a known-playable card and a known-trash card, then discarding the known-trash card instead of playing their known-playable card would *still* communicate a *Scream Discard* to the next player in the exact same way.
* This situation is slightly different than the normal case, so we call it a *Shout Discard* to differentiate it from a more-ordinary *Scream Discard*.
* A *Shout Discard* *Chop Moves* the very next player in the exact way that a *Scream Discard* does.
* A *Shout Discard* forces the next player to **not** discard on their turn in the exact way that a *Scream Discard* does.
* Normally, a *Scream Discard* is only allowed to *Chop Move* a critical card or a playable card. However, unlike a *Scream Discard*, it is permissible to use a *Shout Discard* to *Chop Move* any card that is desirable, even if it is not critical or playable.
* Normally, a *Scream Discard* is only allowed if the team is at 0 clues (or if cluing the card is impossible). However, unlike a *Scream Discard*, it is permissible to use a *Shout Discard* to *Chop Move* regardless of the number of clues that the team has.
* Normally, a *Scream Discard* would turn into an *Echo Scream Discard* if the next player has a playable card. *Shout Discards* can also turn into *Echo Shout Discards*, but only if the team is completely out of clues and it can be seen to be a "last-resort" move.

### The Whisper Discard Chop Move

* Occasionally, a player will have known trash in their hand. Obviously, they are expected to discard the known trash first before discarding their right-most unclued card.
* Thus, if a player instead discards their right-most unclued card instead of the known trash, it must be a signal that something is wrong, exactly like a *Scream Discard*. This is more subtle than a *Scream Discard* though, so it is called a Whisper Discard.
* *Whisper Discards* are to be treated identically to *Scream Discards*. In short, this means that they 1) cause a *Chop Move* and 2) force a clue to be given on the next turn.

### The Echo Scream Discard Chop Move

* A *Scream Discard Chop Move* is done only as a last resort. So, if the next player has an unimportant card on chop, then the move is usually a *Generation Discard* and does not *Chop Move* anyone.
* However, what if a *Scream Discard* is done and the next player has either:
  * a known playable card
  * a known safe trash discard
* Since *Scream Discards* are only done as a last resort, the clue must have some other meaning. So, it *Chop Moves* both the next player **and** the player after that. This is called an *Echo Scream Discard*, because it "bounces" off the next player and travels to the next player after that as a "double scream".
* Similar to a normal *Scream Discard*, all of the players who are *Chop Moved* are not allowed to discard on their next turn.
* In the unlikely scenario where **two** people in a row have known plays / known safe discards, then the *Echo Scream Discard* will bounce off of two people and perform **three** *Chop Moves* in total. (And three people in a row cause four *Chop Moves*, and so forth.)
* An *Echo Whisper Discard* works in the same way.

### The Composition Discard

* In rare cases, it is possible for a discard to be both a *Scream Discard* and a *Generation Discard* at the same time, for two different players.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * There are 0 clues in the bank.
  * Alice needs to plan ahead for her turn.
  * Bob and Donald both have a critical chop card. Cathy has a safe discard.
  * Alice and Bob both have one known playable card in their hand.
  * So, if Alice plays, Bob will perform a *Generation Discard*, and discard a critical card. This is not an option.
  * Therefore, Alice must discard. This is a *Scream Discard* to Bob, and he should *Chop Move*. It is also a *Generation Discard* to Cathy, and she should not *Chop Move*.

### The Rebellious Discard

* Part of the *Scream Discard* convention states that after a *Scream Discard*, the next player **cannot** discard. Thus, a player in this situation must completely waste a clue if there is nothing productive to do.
* However, in some situations, the player who has been screamed at sees that if they give a clue, the next player will be left at 0 clues and will be forced to discard a critical card.
* Thus, in this situation, the player should *Chop Move* as normal and then discard their new chop, which will functionally act as a second *Scream Discard*. This second *Scream Discard* is called a *Rebellious Discard*, because they are not doing what they are told.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Red 4 is in the discard pile.
  * There are 0 clues available.
  * Alice has a known-playable blue 2.
  * Bob has a red 4 on chop. Bob has no playable cards in his hand.
  * Cathy's hand is *Locked*. All of the cards in Cathy's hand are critical. None of these cards are playable.
  * Alice looks into the future and sees that if she plays the blue 2, Bob will be forced to discard the critical red 4, since the team is currently at 0 clues.
  * Thus, Alice performs a *Scream Discard*, discarding instead of playing the known-playable blue 2.
  * Bob knows that Alice performed a *Scream Discard*, so he marks his chop card as *Chop Moved*.
  * Bob also knows that, as per the *Scream Discard* rules, he is not allowed to discard on this turn, and must give some clue instead (in case he has two critical cards in a row).
  * However, in this case, if Bob did that, then Bob would be using the last clue, and then Cathy would not have a clue available and would be forced to discard a critical card.
  * Thus, Bob knows that he must perform a *Rebellious Discard* in order to provide a clue for Cathy to do something.

### The Double Scream Discard Chop Move

* If a player has a known playable card and one known trash card, and then they discard the trash card instead of playing, then that is a *Scream Discard* and the next player should *Chop Move*.
* If a player has a known playable card and two known trash cards, and then they discard the oldest trash card instead of playing, then that is both a *Scream Discard Chop Move* and a *Trash Order Chop Move* at the same time.
* In this situation, the next player should *Chop Move* twice. (This is the composition of a *Scream Discard Chop Move* and a *Trash Order Chop Move*.)

### Phantom Playable Cards

* First, see the section on [the definition of "playable" cards](#play-clues--delayed-play-clues--the-definition-of-playable).
* For a card to be *delayed playable*, it needs to be playable "through" other clued cards or "through" cards on *Finesse Position*. In other words, we are allowed to give *Play Clues* to *delayed playable* cards.
* Consider that a slightly different category of card can exist. A card is *Phantom Playable* is it is playable "through" cards that are visible in someone's hand, but the in-between cards are not on *Finesse Position* and are not yet clued. We are **not** allowed to give *Play Clues* to *Phantom Playable* cards - at least not until the other cards are clued first.
* From *Save Principle*, we know that everyone agrees to not let *playable* or *delayed playable* cards get discarded.
* If possible, the team should also try to protect *Phantom Playable* cards from being discarded as well, since they are nearly as important as *delayed playable* cards. For example, it is common for other people on the team to discard in order to let the player with the *Phantom Playable* card be the one to give a *Play Clue* to the in-between card.
* Sometimes, *Phantom Playable* cards have to be discarded when the team is low on clues or in an otherwise tight situation. While regrettable, this is perfectly okay and does happen from time to time.

### The Scream Discard for a Phantom Playable Card

* First, see the section on the *[Scream Discard](#the-scream-discard-chop-move-deliberately-discarding-instead-of-playing)*.
* Normally, you are only allowed to perform a *Scream Discard* for a critical card or a playable card. But what about a *Phantom Playable Card*?
* In most cases, players should also *Scream Discard* for a *Phantom Playable Card*, but it depends on the situation:
  * Will it be clear to everyone what is happening?
  * Will the in-between cards get clued right away?
  * Are there other critical cards on chop that need to be saved or will need to be saved soon?
  * Is the *Phantom Playable* card a 3 or a 4?
* In summary, it is better for the team to let a *Phantom Playable* card get discarded in a tricky or tight situation, **especially** if it is a 4.
* Another way of saying this is that the team should never "bend over backwards" for a *Phantom Playable* card. Consider that a *Scream Discard* always has a small chance to lose the game (if the *Scream Discarded* card was itself critical).

<br />

## Level 17 - Rarely Used Strategies - Unnecessary Usage of Complicated Moves

* Some complicated moves have special versions that are defined as *unnecessary*.
* For example, it is possible to perform either a *Trash Bluff* or an *Unnecessary Trash Bluff*.
* This section covers these kinds of moves in detail.

### The Definition of Unnecessary

* Experienced players will know about all sorts of tricky ways to "get" cards - the *Trash Bluff*, the *Trash Finesse*, the *Unknown Trash Discharge*, the *Trash Push*, *Double Play Ejection*, and so forth.
* In most cases, these complicated moves end up being a 1-for-1, which is not very efficient. Consider that doing a complicated move like a *Trash Bluff* as a 1-for-1 is pretty pointless if the cluer can instead just give a direct *Play Clue* to the card that needs to be played as a 1-for-1. Giving "normal" *Play Clues* is much more straightforward and has much less of a margin for error!
* Therefore, advanced moves are generally used in situations where the card that needs to be played is hard to clue directly. For example:
  * It could be "blocked" by other cards (e.g. two of the same card in the hand).
  * It could be on chop and "blocked" in the sense that any clue given would look like a *Save Clue* instead of a *Play Clue*.
  * And so on.
* **An *unnecessary* move is defined as a "complicated" move that is performed when the cluer could have instead given a direct play clue.**
* *Unnecessary* moves do "one thing extra" on top of the normal meaning of the move.
  * Depending on the situation, the "extra" thing will be an additional blind-play or a *Chop Move*.
* Remember that a move is only *unnecessary* if it does not have any side benefits. Specifically:
  * A move is **not** *unnecessary* if it "picked up" a extra useful card (e.g. *Unknown Trash Discharges* commonly do this).
  * A move is **not** *unnecessary* if it also fixed an impending misplay or a violation of *Good Touch Principle*.
  * A move is **not** *unnecessary* if it also added more positive information to other previously-clued cards in the hand.

### Unnecessary Moves with Known Trash

* If **known trash** is used as clue target, the "extra" thing is a blind-play from *Finesse Position*. This will usually be Cathy. (e.g. Alice gives a clue, Bob blind-plays from the clue, Cathy blind-plays from the unnecessariness.)
* For example, this would be an *Unnecessary Trash Push* in a 3-player game:
  * All of the 3's are played on the stacks.
  * Bob's hand is completely unclued.
  * Alice clues number 1 to Bob, touching a single 1 on Bob's slot 5 (his chop).
  * Bob knows that this is a *Trash Push* and blind-plays his slot 4. It is a red 4 and it successfully plays.
  * Cathy sees that Bob has no other red cards in his hand. Thus, Alice could easily clued red to Bob in order to "get" the red 4 in a straightforward way. That means that Alice performed an *Unnecessary Trash Push*.
  * Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position*. It is a red 5 and it successfully plays.
* For example, if an *Unnecessary Trash Push Discharge* was done, the next player should blind-play their *Third Finesse Position* (from the clue), and the next player after that should blind-play their *Finesse Position* (from the unnecessariness).
* For example, if an *Unnecessary Trash Chop Move* was done on a card that could be saved directly, the next player should blind-play their *Finesse Position*, and the clue receiver should still *Chop Move*.

### Unnecessary Moves with Unknown Trash (Off-Chop)

* If **unknown trash** is used as a clue target that is off-chop, the "extra" thing is a *Chop Move* (e.g. a *Trash Chop Move*).
* For example, this would be an *Unnecessary Trash Finesse* in a 3-player game:
  * All of the 2's are played on the stacks except for the red 2.
  * Bob has a red 2 on his *Finesse Position* and no other red cards in his hand. Thus, Alice could give a red clue to Bob in order to "get" the red 2.
  * Cathy's hand is completely unclued.
  * Alice clues number 2 to Cathy, touching a blue 2 on slot 4. (Blue 2 is already played and is therefore trash.)
  * Bob knows that from Cathy's perspective, Alice's clue looks like a *Play Clue* on the final remaining 2 - the red 2. Cathy will go on to misplay the blue 2 as the red 2.
  * Thus, Bob knows that this is a *Trash Finesse* or *Trash Bluff*. He blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is a red 2 and it successfully plays.
  * Cathy now knows that her 2 is trash (since Bob blind-played in response to the clue). However, Cathy also knows that this *Trash Finesse* was *unnecessary*, as Alice could have just clued red to Bob.
  * Thus, Cathy knows that this is an *Unnecessary Trash Finesse*, so she marks her slot 5 card as being *Chop Moved*.
* For example, if an *Unnecessary Unknown Trash Discharge* was done, the next player should blind-play their *Third Finesse Position* (from the clue), and the clue receiver should *Chop Move* (from the unnecessariness).
* Importantly, note that *Unnecessary Chop Moves* are tricky in that they have **information asymmetry**: the player who blind-plays will **not** know that the card is chop moved, while everyone else will. All players will have to keep this in mind until the *Chop Move* has been demonstrated.

### Unnecessary Moves with Unknown Trash (On-Chop)

* If **unknown trash** is used as a clue target that is on-chop, but the clue **also** touched other trash cards in the hand that were not on chop, then the "extra" thing is a *Chop Move* (e.g. a *Trash Chop Move*), similar to the previous section.
* If **unknown trash** is used as a clue target that is on-chop, and the clue only touched one card (or all the cards touched were also on chop), then the "extra" thing is a blind-play (e.g. a *Trash Push*).
* For example, this would be an *Unnecessary Trash Finesse* in a 3-player game:
  * All of the 2's are played on the stacks except for the red 2.
  * Bob has a red 2 on his *Finesse Position* and no other red cards in his hand. Thus, Alice could give a red clue to Bob in order to "get" the red 2.
  * Cathy's hand is completely unclued.
  * Alice clues number 2 to Cathy, touching a blue 2 on slot 5. (Blue 2 is already played and is therefore trash.)
  * Bob knows that from Cathy's perspective, Alice's clue looks like a *Play Clue* on the final remaining 2 - the red 2. Cathy will go on to misplay the blue 2 as the red 2.
  * Thus, Bob knows that this is a *Trash Finesse* or *Trash Bluff*. He blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is a red 2 and it successfully plays.
  * Cathy now knows that her 2 is trash (since Bob blind-played in response to the clue). However, Cathy also knows that this *Trash Finesse* was *unnecessary*, as Alice could have just clued red to Bob.
  * Thus, Cathy knows that this is an *Unnecessary Trash Finesse*. Normally, she would *Chop Move* something, but the focus of the clue was already on her chop. Cathy instead blind-plays her slot 4 as a *Trash Push*.

### Other Examples

* More examples of a *unnecessary* moves can be found [here](examples/Unnecessary_Principles.md).

### The Unnecessary Forced Reverse Trash Finesse (A Gentleman's Discard That Looks Like an Unnecessary Reverse Trash Finesse)

* First, see the section on [Unnecessary Moves with Known Trash](#unnecessary-moves-with-known-trash), which defines what a *Unnecessary Trash Finesse* is. Basically, if a *Trash Finesse* is unnecessary, then it also causes a *Chop Move*.
* This convention also applies to *Reverse Trash Finesses*. If they are unnecessary, then it causes a *Chop Move* in the same way.
* If a line is chosen that forces a *Gentleman's Discard* to occur (because they have to entertain the possibility of a *Reverse Trash Finesse*), and the blind-playing card could have been clued in some other easier way, then it **still** *Chop Moves* in exactly the same way that an *Unnecessary Reverse Trash Finesse* would.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * This is a slightly modified version of the example given for the *Reverse Trash Finesse*.
  * The red 1 is played on the stacks. All of the 2's are played on the other stacks.
  * Alice clues number 2 to Bob, touching his slot 1 card as a *Play Clue*.
  * From Bob's perspective, this is probably just a *Play Clue* on the red 2 (which happens to be the final 2 that needs to be played).
  * However, Bob sees that Cathy also has a red 2 on her *Finesse Position*. That means that this could be a *Reverse Trash Finesse*.
  * If it is a *Reverse Trash Finesse*, then his 2 is a trash 2 (e.g. green 2). By immediately discarding it, it will prove to Cathy that *she* has a red 2.
  * Alternatively, if Bob does indeed have the red 2, then he can discard it to perform a *Gentleman's Discard* on Cathy.
  * Either way, discarding will cover both cases. Bob discards the 2 and it is revealed to be a red 2.
  * Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card as red 2 and it successfully plays.
  * Alice discards.
  * Bob knows that even though *Gentleman's Discards* are never supposed to cause a *Chop Move*, Alice forced him to discard in exactly the same way as a *Reverse Trash Finesse*. Furthermore, it was possible to cleanly clue the red 2 in Cathy's hand to begin with, and doing so would have been much simpler. Thus, doing the pseudo-*Reverse Trash Finesse* was unnecessary.
  * Since it was unnecessary, Bob chop moves all the cards to the right of where the red 2 was (slot 2, slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5).

### The Trash Push Inverted Finesse

* First, see the section on [Unnecessary Moves with Known Trash](#unnecessary-moves-with-known-trash), which defines what a *Unnecessary Trash Push* is. Basically, if a *Trash Push* is unnecessary, then it also causes an extra blind-play.
* Normally, the *Unnecessary Trash Push* calls for the very next player to blind-play an unrelated card, similar to a *Bluff*.
* However, if the very next player can see that it could be a *Finesse* through the *Trash Pushed* card, then they should prefer that interpretation. This is similar to how Bob should always prefer a *Finesse* interpretation over a *Bluff* interpretation.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 1 to Cathy, touching a single 1 on her chop. Since all of the 1's are already played, it is globally known that this must be some kind of *Trash Push*.
  * Bob sees that the pushed card is a red 3. Cathy has no other red cards in her hand, so Alice could have just clued red to Cathy instead of doing a complicated *Trash Push*.
  * Thus, Bob knows that this is an *Unnecessary Trash Push*. Normally, Bob would immediately blind-play his *Finesse Position* card. However, Bob also sees that Donald has a red 4 in his *Finesse Position*. Since *Finesses* take precedence over *Bluffs*, Bob knows that he should let Donald be the one to blind-play from the unnecessariness.
  * Bob discards.
  * Cathy knows that this must be a *Trash Push*. Cathy blind-plays her slot 3 card. It is red 3 instead and it successfully plays.
  * Similar to Bob, Donald also sees that the *Trash Push* was unnecessary. Since Bob did not blind-play anything, this must be a *Trash Push Inverted Finesse*. Donald blind-plays his *Finesse Position* as red 4 and it successfully plays.

## Level 17 - Rarely Used Strategies - Miscellaneous

### The Selfish Clue

* A *Selfish Clue* is when a player:
  1) has a playable card in their hand (e.g. red 2)
  2) gives a *Play Clue* to the next connecting card (e.g. red 3)
* In almost all cases, there is no reason to give a *Selfish Clue*. Players can simply play their playable card and let someone else on the team "get" the next card. Being *Selfish* is typically associated with having bad teamwork.
* However, in rare cases, giving a *Selfish Clue* can be good.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice has a globally-known playable red 2 in her hand.
  * Bob hand is as follows, from newest to oldest: `blue 1, red 3, red 4, red 5, blue 1`
  * Both Bob and Cathy has a safe discard.
  * Alice knows that on this turn, she is expected to play the red 2, unless she has a really good clue to give.
  * Alice sees that if she plays the red 2, then Bob will probably have nothing to do, and will go on to discard the blue 1.
  * At that point, the red 5 will be on chop, and it will be difficult for the team to get all of the red cards. Specifically, someone will probably have to give a number 3 clue to Bob as a 1-for-1 on the red 3.
  * Alice sees that if she gives a red clue to Bob *right now* (e.g. before she plays the red 2), then she will be able to "lock-in" a nice 3-for-1 clue. Even though the team will lose *Tempo*, this will be inconsequential because Bob has a safe discard and Cathy has a safe discard.
  * Alice clues red to Bob as a *Selfish Play Clue*.

### Deferring a Bluff

* From *Urgency Principle*, we know that players are allowed to defer a *Finesse* or a *Bluff* in order to do a *Finesse* or *Bluff* of their own. And indeed, when players see a really good clue, they should probably defer blind-playing to give the clue. But there are limits.
* When a player knows for sure that they are *Finessed* (instead of *Bluffed*), then deferring a *Finesse* (to perform another *Finesse* or *Bluff*) is great! It has almost no downsides, other than the obvious loss of tempo. Everyone on the team is "in the know", so to speak.
* When a player *could* be *Bluffed*, deferring a *Bluff* can be extremely dangerous because it causes *Information Desynchronization* throughout the team.
* Deferring a *Bluff* to perform a *Finesse* can be pretty clear, depending on the situation. It should be done sparingly.
  * Note that deferring a *Bluff* to perform a *Finesse* can potentially lose the game if the original cluer is performing a *Double Half Bluff*. So there is some risk involved.
* Deferring a *Bluff* to perform **another** *Bluff* is much worse. Since the *Bluff* was not immediately resolved, the game state "fractures" into two valid game states for the receivers of each clue (e.g. the player who received the clue that initiated the first *Bluff*, and the player who received the clue that initiated the *Deferred Bluff*). This means that these two players will have to entertain two entire hypothetical game states in their mind and build upon each hypothetical with each new piece of information. This makes it extremely difficult for them to plan ahead or make correct decisions during their turns.
* Thus, deferring a *Bluff* to do another *Bluff* should **almost never be performed**.
* Also, see the below section on *Deferring a Double Bluff*.

### Deferring a Double Bluff

* First, see the section on *[Deferring a Bluff](#deferring-a-bluff)*.
* If Bob suspects that Alice is performing a *Double Bluff*, then Bob should **never defer**. It is very important that *Double Bluffs* resolve immediately.
* Similarly, if Bob blind-plays, and Cathy can not rule out a *Double Bluff*, then Cathy should **never defer**. (If Cathy defers, it will cause an unrecoverable *Information Desynchronization*, because her future blind-play will not be interpreted as related to the *Double Bluff*.)

### A Table for Deferring Bluffs

| Alice is deferring a               | to perform a | Ok?
| ---------------------------------- | ------------ | ---
| Finesse                            | Finesse      | Yes!
| Finesse                            | Bluff        | Yes!
| Bluff                              | Finesse      | Sometimes, use sparingly
| Bluff                              | Bluff        | Almost never do this
| Double Bluff (first blind-player)  | Finesse      | No, **never** do this
| Double Bluff (first blind-player)  | Bluff        | No, **never** do this
| Double Bluff (second blind-player) | Finesse      | No, **never** do this
| Double Bluff (second blind-player) | Bluff        | No, **never** do this

### Trash Touch Elimination

* After deciding on the target of a clue, players carefully choose between using a color clue and a number clue in order to avoid violating *Good Touch Principle* with the ancillary cards that will be touched (since every clued card is treated as a card that will eventually be played). Sometimes, when both a color clue **and** a number would violate *Good Touch Principle*, players are forced to pick between the lesser of two evils.
* However, sometimes you can see that it **is** possible to use a color or number clue to uniquely touch a clue target without "picking up" extra bad cards. So, when extra bad cards are deliberately touched in this way, it is conveying an extra special message.
* When this occurs and there is exactly one "missing" card, players should write an *Elimination Note* in their hand for the missing card. This is called *Trash Touch Elimination*.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Red 3 is played on the stacks. All of the other suits have the 1 played on the stacks.
  * Bob's hand is, from newest to oldest: red 4, red 1, blue 1, green 1, yellow 1.
  * Alice wants to give a play clue to the red 4. Everyone else on the team (other than Bob) can see that she can give either number 4 or red.
    * If Alice clues number 4, then it will uniquely touch the red 4 (which will satisfy *Good Touch Principle*).
    * If Alice clues red, then it will touch the red 4 and the red 1 (which will **violate** *Good Touch Principle*).
  * Alice clues red to Bob. Since nothing was stopping her from cluing number 4, this is very strange.
  * Bob plays the red 4.
  * There is only one "missing" red card - the red 5. Cathy knows that normally, Bob would think that his red 1 is the red 5 (from *Good Touch Principle*). This must mean that Cathy has the red 5. Cathy writes *Trash Touch Elimination Notes* on her hand for the red 5.
* As a clarification, if there are two unseen copies of a single missing card, then *Trash Touch Elimination* does not apply. Players should instead interpret this situation as a *[Weak Trash Finesse](#the-trash-finesse-weak-form)*.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Red 2 is played on the stacks. All of the other suits have the 1 played on the stacks.
  * Bob's hand is, from newest to oldest: red 3, red 1, blue 1, green 1, yellow 1.
  * Alice wants to give a play clue to the red 3. Everyone else on the team (other than Bob) can see that she can give either number 3 or red.
    * If Alice clues number 3, then it will uniquely touch the red 3 (which will satisfy *Good Touch Principle*).
    * If Alice clues red, then it will touch the red 3 and the red 1 (which will **violate** *Good Touch Principle*).
  * Alice clues red to Bob. Since nothing was stopping her from cluing number 4, this is very strange.
  * Bob plays the red 3.
  * Cathy has a red 5 in her hand. It is fully "filled-in" by previous clues.
  * Thus, there is only one "missing" red card - the red 4. Cathy knows that normally, Bob would think that his red 1 is the red 4 (from *Good Touch Principle*). This must mean that Cathy has the red 4.
  * Normally, Cathy would write *Trash Touch Elimination* notes for the red 4. However, both copies of the red 4 are missing / not visible. Thus, Cathy knows that this doesn't count as a "single card". Cathy instead knows that this must be a *[Weak Trash Finesse](the-trash-finesse-weak-form)*.

### The Hesitation Blind-Play

* Sometimes, a player will receive a *Play Clue* on a card. And then, instead of playing it, they will discard their chop instead. This would normally indicate some sort of emergency. However, sometimes it can be seen that there is nothing special going on and that everybody has safe chop cards.
* In such a situation, if the player is not making a mistake, the only reason that they would discard is that they are allowing for the possibility of a *Prompt* or a *Reverse Finesse* - someone else on the team has a playable card (either clued or on *Finesse Position*) that "matches" the card that they got the *Play Clue* on.
* Depending on the game state, clever players may be able to blind-play their *Finesse Position* card in response to this hesitation, getting a card for "free". This kind of move is called a *Hesitation Blind-Play*.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Red 1 and all of the other 2's are played on the stacks.
  * The team has 5 clues. Nobody on the team has any cards clued in their hand.
  * Alice clues number 3 to Bob, touching a blue 3 on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*. (The team is now at 4 clues.)
  * Bob discards. (The team is now at 5 clues.)
  * From Cathy's perspective, Bob was supposed to play the blue 3 immediately instead of discarding.
  * Cathy knows that since the team has so many clues available, this cannot be a *Scream Discard* from Bob. (*Scream Discards* are only typically done when the team is at 0 or 1 clues.)
  * Thus, Cathy knows that Bob must be hesitating because is he allowing for the possibility of a *Reverse Finesse*. In this situation, the only possible card that could Bob could be hesitating for is red 2.
  * Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card. It is red 2 and it successfully plays.
  * Alice discards.
  * Bob knows that since Cathy blind-played the red 2, Alice did a *Reverse Finesse* and that he has the red 3.
  * Bob plays the 3, but it is revealed to be blue 3 instead of red 3.
  * Bob now knows that nobody has the red 3 and that Cathy blind-played the red 2 from Bob's hesitation.
* *Hesitation Blind Plays* are **not always safe** to do:
  * If a player could be hesitating for a clued card in your hand **or** your *Finesse Position* card, then you cannot act on the hesitation. (If you guess wrong, you could misplay a critical card.)
  * If a player could be hesitating for a card that is identical to the card that was clued, then you cannot act on the hesitation. (If you blind-play the same copy of the card, then they will go on to misplay the clued card.)
  * If blind-playing a particular card would cause the original clue to look like a *Double Finesse* with a "self" component, then you cannot act on the hesitation. (For example, if a number 4 clue causes a *Hesitation Blind-Play* of a red 2, the clue receiver would go on to misplay their *Finesse Position* card as the red 3.)

### The Hesitation Chop Move (From a Misplay)

* Remember that as a special exception, *Scream Discards* do **not** apply when a player has a "blind" card to play in their hand **and** the blind card can exist in your hand.
* Thus, when this occurs, you will usually want to blind-play your *Finesse Position* card, since this sequence of events indicates either an *Ambiguous Finesse* or a *Pass Bluff*.
* When you blind-play a card in this situation and it misplays, it means that the unusual discard really was a *Scream Discard* after all, so you should treat it like a normal *Scream Discard* and permanently *Chop Move*.
* This is called a *Hesitation Chop Move* for short, since it was triggered by a (failed) *Hesitation Blind-Play*.

### Double Prompts in Multi-Color Variants

* Normally, when a multi-color card is *Prompted* from someone's hand, they should play the card that has the most positive information.
* However, what if they are *Prompted* for two cards of the same multi-color suit? They should play the card with the most positive information first, even if it is not the left-most card.
* For example, in a 3-player rainbow game:
  * Rainbow 1 is played on the stacks.
  * Bob has a slot 1 card that has a blue clue on it. (Thus, it is either a blue card or a rainbow card.)
  * Bob also has a slot 3 card that has a blue clue and a red clue on it. (Thus, it is a known rainbow card.)
  * Alice clues Cathy about a rainbow 4.
  * Bob is promised the rainbow 2 and the rainbow 3, so he knows that these cards must be on slots 1 and slot 3.
  * However, Bob also knows that you should always play the card with the most information on it first, so he plays his slot 3 card as rainbow 2 (instead of slot 1, the left-most card).

### The Inverted 5's Tempo Clue

* Normally, if a color clue "fills in" a 5 (that was previously touched), and the clue touches no other cards in the hand, then it is obviously focused on the 5 - the 5 is playable right now.
* However, as a special exception, if doing so makes *another* 5 in that player's hand known to be playable, then the clue is said to be focused on the other 5, making the original card clued **not** playable right now.
* Since *Inverted 5's Tempo Clues* only get one card played, they are also *Tempo Clue Chop Moves* like any other *Tempo Clue*.

### Double Tempo Clue Inversion (Immediate Double Clue)

* If a player is clued the exact same thing twice before it gets to be their turn, it means that they can play **all** of the cards that the clue touched, but in the opposite order than normal (right-to-left, since you would normally play cards from left-to-right).
  * If one of the cards includes the chop card, it means to play all of the cards from 2nd oldest to newest, and then the chop last.
* If you are re-clued about a bunch of cards after you have already taken a turn, see the *Double Tempo Clue* section.

### The Elimination Rewrite (For 1's)

* Normally, when a playable card is discarded, a player will write *Elimination Notes* on their hand for the other copy of the card.
* However, there is a special case when **two** copies of the same 1 are discarded. The original *Elimination Notes* from the discard of the first 1 no longer apply because it is possible that the player has drawn the third copy of the 1 before the second copy could be clued.
* Thus, when a player discards the second copy of a playable 1, they should delete all of their *Elimination Notes* from the first discard and rewrite all of the *Elimination Notes* on the rest of their hand anew (essentially acting like the second discard was the first discard).
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice discards a red 1. Alice writes *Elimination Notes* on her slot 2, slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5.
  * On her next turn, Alice discards an unrelated card. She now has *Elimination Notes* on slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5.
  * On her next turn, Alice discards another red 1. Normally, she would now have *Elimination Notes* on slot 4 and slot 5. However, because of the *Elimination Rewrite*, she instead writes *Elimination Notes* on slot 2, slot 3, slot 4, and slot 5.

### The Continuation Clue (Touching Both Inside and Outside a Layer)

* Sometimes, a player who is blind-playing cards into a *Layered Finesse* receives another clue that touches cards **both** inside the layer and outside the layer.
* By default, the player should assume that it is another normal *Play Clue* or *Save Clue* on a card outside of the layer, and **continue** to blind-play cards. This follows from *Information Lock Principle*. *Play Clues* given in this manner are called *Continuation Clues*.
* Because *Continuation Clues* are the default interpretation, it can be difficult to give a *Fix Clue*, since a *Fix Clue* must **only** touch cards inside of the layer.

### The Just-In-Time Fix Clue (To Fix a Layered Finesse with a Lie Component) (JIT)

* When performing a *Layered Finesse* with a *Lie Component*, if the plan is to give a *Fix Clue* to the *Finesse Target* card (the "final" card that is to be blind-played), then it is important to wait until the **last** moment to give the *Fix Clue*. This is because after receiving the *Fix Clue*, the player will not play any more blind cards.
* Thus, you should first wait for all of the "good" blind cards to play, and **then** give the *Fix Clue* to the *Finesse Target*, so that it comes "just in time" before the misplay.
* Alternatively, if the plan is to give a *Fix Clue* to some **other** card than the *Finesse Target* (e.g. a number 5 clue to a 5 in the middle of the hand), then the *Fix Clue* does not necessarily have to be just in time. It can be done early, and the player will know that they have to continue blind-playing cards until they find the *Finesse Target*.

### The Top Hat Clue

* Since the *Layered Gentleman's Discard* is so efficient, clever players that see the opportunity to perform one will almost always want to do so.
* Thus, it follows that in rare cases, when a teammate gives you a play clue on some card, they **do not** intend for you to play it. They intend for you to see the opportunity for a *Layered Gentleman's Discard*, and then immediately discard the card.
* This kind of clue is called a *Top Hat Clue* because you are giving them an opportunity to be a gentleman.
* Note that you should **not** mistake a *Top Hat Clue* a clue that initiates a *Layered Finesse*. You are only allowed to discard a clued card if you can determine its exact identity.

### The Negative Blind-Play

* Given enough negative clues on a card (and potentially some ancillary information based on the history of the game), it is possible to narrow down the identity of an unclued card in your hand to possibilities that only include playable cards that are not already touched in someone else's hand.
* In this situation, you are expected to blind-play the card.

### The Negative Self-Chop Move

* If a card has negative 1, 2, 3, and 4 on it, then it is explicitly known to be a 5, while not directly clued.
* In this situation, it would be a waste of a clue for the team to clue it directly.
* Thus, the player should self-chop move the card.

### The Speed-Up Clue

* The *Layered Finesse* convention (and its derivatives) are very efficient (in terms of "X for 1"). However, sometimes it can be very slow (low tempo), as players will have to allow for all possible *Reverse Finesses* before playing anything. This is generally not a problem in 3-player games, but tempo is important in 5-player games.
* Normally, when the *Finesse Target* (the card that is to be blind-played) is clued directly, it is a mistake due to someone not paying close enough attention. We refer to this as *Stomping on a Finesse*.
* However, if high tempo is needed, a player can consider intentionally *stomping* on a *Layered Finesse* in order to "speed up" the play of a specific card that leads into other players hands.
* One complicating factor of the *Speed-up Clue* is how to differentiate it from a more-ordinary *Fix Clue*. In other words, after the clued card is played, on their next turn, should the player go back and blind-play the other cards? If it was a *Speed-up Clue*, they should. If it was a *Fix Clue*, they should not.
* The key lies in the context of the clue:
  * Would another player have tried to blind-play something before the potential *Fix Clue* was given? If yes, then it is not a *Fix Clue*, and it is a *Speed-up Clue*.
  * Was it possible to take an equivalent line where a *Fix Clue* would not be needed? (In terms of the same number of clues, and no risk of discarding critical/playable cards.) If yes, it is not a *Speed-up Clue*.

### The Layered Jump

* If a player who is blind-playing into a *Layered Finesse* skips over a card, they are performing a *Layered Jump*. This player has deduced that the card they are skipping over is duplicated (or otherwise bad).
* The card skipped over in this way will be the next thing discarded, as it is now considered known trash.
* If a *Layered Jump* skips over a card that cannot be in your own hand, then you can determine that it must be a mistake. In this situation, the skipped-over card must be clued directly to re-signify that it is good.

### The Certain Discard Duplication Promise

* As the recipient of a *Finesse*, you are promised a card that you have to blind-play. However, as long as it is not a *Certain Finesse*, you **have** to account for the possibility of a *Layered Finesse*. This means that you can never blind-discard the promised card to perform a *Gentleman's Discard*, for example.
* After the *Finesse* has occurred, but before the promised card has been blind-played, there is a window where a teammate might find strategic value in duplicating the promised card in someone else's hand.
* Unless the duplication was a last-resort, if the teammate duplicates the blind card, it **promises** that the duplicated card is on *Finesse Position* (and there is **no** *Layered Finesse*), which allows the recipient of the *Finesse* to blind-discard that card, similar to a *Certain Discard*.
* Finally, from the perspective of the player receiving the clue, if they end up playing the duplicated card first, then they should know that the focus of the original clue was on the other, non-duplicated card, and they can play it immediately afterwards. (Otherwise, the original clue would be fairly low-value.)
* Note that as long as the duplication clue touches two or more cards, the *Certain Discard Duplication Promise* interpretation takes priority over the *Unknown Trash Discharge* interpretation. (*Discharge* is an advanced move that is covered later on.)

### The Certain Finesse Clandestine Exception

* This section outlines a specific and rare edge-case for *Certain Finesses*.
* We agree that *Bluffs* take precedence over *Certain Finesses*. This means that a *Certain Finesse* cannot normally be performed from *Bluff Seat*.
* *Certain Finesses* **can** be performed from *Bluff Seat* if it is strictly impossible to be a *Bluff*. In other words, this means that it is illegal for a player to perform a *Clandestine Finesse* on the very next player that targets a potentially duplicated card **and** the other player can rule out the possibility of a *Bluff*.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All of the 2's & blue 3 is played on the stacks. Green 3 is in the discard pile.
  * Alice has an unknown 3 in her hand that happens to be the red 3.
  * Alice clues number 4 to Cathy, touching a red 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob knows that Alice could be trying to perform a *Finesse* on a red 3. Normally, he would blind-discard his *Finesse Position* card as a *Certain Discard* in order to pass this card back to Alice.
  * However, Bob also knows that this might be a *Bluff*. But wait - his *Finesse Position* card has negative blue on it. So anything that he blind-plays here would have to be a 3. Thus, this cannot be a *Bluff*, since a 3 would match a 4 and look like a *Finesse*.
  * The only other possibility that Bob has to worry about is a *Clandestine Finesse*. For example, he could be blind-playing a green 3 **and then** a red 3 after that. If he blind-discarded, that could "kill" the green stack, since the other copy of green 3 is already discarded.
  * However, Bob **also** knows that you are not allowed to perform a *Clandestine Finesse* from *Bluff Seat* that could duplicate a card in your hand. Thus, he can discount both the possibility of a *Bluff* **and** the possibility of a *Clandestine Finesse*.
  * Bob performs a *Certain Discard* on his *Finesse Position* card and it is the red 3, successfully passing it back to Alice.
* If someone performs a *Certain Discard* and you have two or more clued cards that could be the target, then you are not promised the order, only that you have the card clued somewhere in your hand. (This part works in the exact same way as a more-ordinary *Sarcastic Discard*.)

### Selfish Focus Inversion (SFI)

* First, see the section on the *[Selfish Clue](#the-selfish-clue)*.
* Normally, when a player gives a *Selfish Clue*, they are doing it because no-one else on the team can perform the clue and they want to "lock-in" the value.
* However, if a player gives a *Selfish Clue* with a color that could have been easily given by someone else on the team, then that is quite strange, and they must be trying to send a deeper message.
* In this situation, they are trying to communicate that the focus of the clue should be inverted. The *Play Clue* is either on the left-most card (if it would normally be *Chop Focus*) or on the right-most card (if it would normally be the left-most card).
* *Selfish Focus Inversion* can **only** be performed with color clues.
* *Selfish Focus Inversion* takes precedence over an *Out-of-Order Finesse*. (This follows from *Occam's Razor*; if it could just be a normal *Focus Inversion* play clue, then it does not necessarily promise any blind-plays.)
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob clues blue to Alice as a *Play Clue* on a blue 1.
  * Instead of playing her red 1, Cathy clues red to Donald, touching a red 3 on slot 1 and a red 2 on slot 2. This must be a *Play Clue*, since these cards are not on Donald's chop.
  * Donald knows that since Cathy is not playing her red 1 and giving a clue, she must have a good reason.
  * Donald looks around the table and does not see the red 2 in anybody else's *Finesse Position*. Thus, this cannot be a *Selfish Finesse*.
  * Donald also knows that this cannot be a *Self Finesse* or *Self Bluff*. (*Self Bluffs* with color are explicitly illegal.)
  * This must be an *Selfish Focus Inversion*, so Donald marks his right-most card as red 2 for later. The other red card in his hand can be red 3, red 4, or red 5. Donald discards.

### The Blaze Discard (A Gentleman's Discard or Baton Discard That Promises the Wrong Slot)

* Normally, if a player performs a *Gentleman's Discard* and the other card is **not** on *Finesse Position*, it could one of two things:
  1) If the card on *Finesse Position* is itself playable right now, then it would be a *Layered Gentleman's Discard*.
  2) If the card on *Finesse Position* is not playable right now, then it is an emergency situation or a player is making a mistake.
* Alternatively, if a player performs a *Baton Discard* and the other card is **not** on *Finesse Position*, then it is an emergency situation or a player is making a mistake.
* If this is the case, and it is **not** an emergency situation and the player is **not** making a mistake, then the player who is performing the weird *Gentleman's Discard* (or *Baton Discard*) must be trying to communicate something extra.
* In this situation, the discarding player intends for the very next player to blind-play the *Finesse Position* that **matches the true *Finesse Position*** of the other card. This is called a *Blaze Discard* because it "ignites" the next player's hand to fix the problem.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice discards a known red 2 as a *Gentleman's Discard*.
  * Bob sees that Cathy's hand is completely unclued and is as follows, from left to right: `red 1 (trash), red 2, green 1 (trash), green 1 (trash), blue 1 (trash)`
  * Bob knows that normally, the *Gentleman's Discard* promises that the other copy of the red 2 is on *Finesse Position*. But Alice is lying to Cathy, because she will go on to misplay the red 1 as the red 2.
  * Bob knows that it would be pointless for Alice to perform a *Gentleman's Discard* and then for Bob to give a *Fix Clue*, as that would waste a clue. So, if Alice is not making a mistake, she must be trying to communicate something extra.
  * Bob knows that this must be a *Blaze Discard* and he must blind-play the *Finesse Position* that matches the *Finesse Position* of the other card. In this case, since the red 2 is on Cathy's *Second Finesse Position* (slot 2), Bob must play his *Second Finesse Position* (slot 2).
  * Bob blind-plays slot 2. It is a blue 2 and it successfully plays.
  * From Cathy's perspective, she first suspects that some kind of *Ejection* is going on, since Bob blind-played his *Second Finesse Position*. However, since the previous action was a *Gentleman's Discard*, Alice knows that this must be a *Blaze Discard*. In other words, Bob was just blind-playing his *Second Finesse Position* to communicate to Cathy that she should play her *Second Finesse Position* instead of her *First Finesse Position*.
  * Cathy blind-plays the red 2 from slot 2.
* *Blaze Discards* do not apply when someone performs a *Gentleman's Discard* or a *Baton Discard* that looks like a *Sarcastic Discard*. In these situations, one of the following is true:
  * The discarding player is making a mistake (as a *Wrong Prompt*).
  * The discarding player is not making a mistake and there is enough past context for the player with the cards to be able to tell the difference.
* Remember that *Blaze Discards* work with *Finesse Positions*, **not** with slot numbers.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Alice discards a red 3 as a *Blaze Discard*.
  * Bob sees that Cathy has the other copy of the red 3. However, it is on slot 2 instead of on slot 1. (Cathy's hand is completely unclued.) Thus, Bob has to communicate to Cathy that it is actually on her *Second Finesse Position*.
  * Bob has a clued 5 on his slot 1. Thus, Bob's *Finesse Position* is on slot 2 and his *Second Finesse Position* is on slot 3.
  * Bob blind-plays his *Second Finesse Position* (slot 3). It is a blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  * Cathy knows that because Bob blind-played his slot 3, the red 3 must be on her slot 2.
* Note that it is illegal to perform an *Ambiguous Blaze Discard*. We want to keep *Blaze Discards* as simple as possible.
* Note that it is illegal to perform a *Layered Blaze Discard* (on either the ignited player or the player holding the matching card). We want to keep *Blaze Discards* as simple as possible.

### The No-Context Double Gentleman's Discard

* Normally, when someone performs a *Gentleman's Discard*, it only promises the exact other copy of the card, even if the discarded card could have been multiple different things. The reason for this is it allows for asymmetric reads.
* However, what if a *Gentleman's Discard* is done, and the card could have been multiple different things, and there was no context and no possible way to know which exact card that it was?
* In this case, then it is a legal *Double Gentleman's Discard*, and it promises that both of the possibilities exist. (Or, it could even be a *Triple Gentleman's Discard*.)
* For example, in a 3-player three suit game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 1 to Bob, touching a 1 on slot 3.
  * From everyone's perspective, this 1 could be any 1 in the game - blue 1, green 1, or yellow 1.
  * Bob discards the card and it is revealed to be a blue 1.
  * Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card, and it is a blue 1.
  * Normally, Alice knows that Bob's discard would only promise the blue 1 (and not promise the green 1 or the yellow 1). However, since the game started on the turn before the clue was given, there is no possible way that Bob could have figured out the exact identity of the card in such a short amount of time.
  * Thus, since Alice does not see the green 1 or the yellow 1 in other people's hands, Alice knows that she must have the green 1 **and** the yellow 1 on her *Finesse Position* and *Second Finesse Position*.

## Variant-Specific Strategies

### Hard Variants & Easy Variants

* Some variants demand an enormous amount of efficiency. Since our normal conventions result in conservative play, we agree to change the way that we play in some specific variants in order to win more consistently.
* The necessary efficiency needed in order to win each variant is located on [the efficiency tables page](misc/Efficiency.md).
* We define any variant that requires equal to or greater than 1.25 efficiency as a "hard" variant. (Required efficiency can be seen in-game using the Hanab Live interface. Note that a variant can be considered easy in 4-player, but hard in 5-player, for example.)
* Additionally, the following variants are considered to be hard variants even though they may have less than 1.25 required efficiency:
  * Any variant with a null suit
  * Color Mute
  * Number Mute
  * Special Mix
  * Dual-Color Mix
  * Throw It in a Hole
  * Cow & Pig
  * Duck
* In hard variants, the following changes are made to the conventions:
  * Players are not allowed to *Double Discard Avoid*. Any clue given in a *Double Discard* situation will instead be treated like a clue given in a non-*Double Discard* situation.
  * Players are not allowed to *5 Stall* in the *Early Game*. Any clue that looks like a *5 Stall* is instead treated as either a *5's Chop Move* or a *5 Pull*.
  * Players are not required to clue anything in the *Early Game*; they are allowed to initiate the *Mid-Game* whenever they see fit.

### Loaded Play Clues in Hard Variants (Part 1)

* Normally, players are allowed to give a *Save Clue* to a card on chop, even if that player has a bunch of playable cards to play. This kind of thing is referred to as an *Early Save*. (Allowing *Early Saves* is nice because it allows for *Discard Modulation.*)
* In *Hard* variants (see previous section), *Early Saves* are not legal.
* If a clue is given to a chop card of a player, and that player has one or more known-playable cards to play, then it is treated as a *Play Clue* on that card.
* This is called a *Loaded Play Clue* to distinguish it from a more ordinary *Play Clue*, because the player receiving the clue is currently "loaded" with a play.
* *Loaded Play Clues* **do not** apply in the *Early Game* - they are only "turned on" in the *Mid-Game*.
* *Loaded Play Clues* **do not** apply in *Double Discard* situations. (Even though *Double Discard Avoidance* is "turned off" in hard variants in general, players are still allowed to avoid *Double Discarding* by giving *Early Saves* to cards.)

### Loaded Play Clues in Hard Variants (Part 2)

* *Loaded Play Clues* also apply to the *5's Chop Move*. This means that any clue that looks like a *5's Chop Move* will instead look like a *Loaded Play Clue* (if the clue receiver is currently "loaded" with a play).
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Red 3 is played on the stacks.
  * Bob has a known red 4 in his hand on slot 5.
  * Alice clues number 5 to Bob, touching a 5 on slot 3.
  * Bob knows that in a normal game, since the 5 was one-away from chop, Alice's clue would be a *5's Chop Move*.
  * Bob also knows that in hard variants, the *5's Chop Move* convention is turned off when the player receiving the clue is "loaded' with a play. Thus, this must be a *Loaded Play Clue* on the 5.
  * Bob plays the red 4 and will play the 5 on the next turn as red 5.

### Empty Clues

* *Empty Clues* are clues that touch no cards in a hand. On Hanab Live, each game has the option to allow *Empty Clues*. In our group, we typically disallow this option since it makes the game too easy.
* If *Empty Clues* are enabled, it allows for a much wider channel of information transfer. We have developed an entire convention framework around this channel and it is too complicated to cover in a single section here.
* If you are interested in learning about in the extended *Empty Clue* conventions, they are documented [on a separate page](misc/Empty_Clues.md).

## Convention Attribution

### General Terms

* The general terms of chop, *Finesse*, and *Bluff* were not invented by this group. Those basic strategies were the building blocks for the current Hyphen-ated framework.
* "Chop" is a term invented by [Ben Smalls](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/smallman), one of the more prominent early Hanabi players. The earliest mention of the word on the Board Game Geek forums comes from [his post back in 2013](https://boardgamegeek.com/article/13665606#13665606).
* A "finesse" is a common strategy in [bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finesse), so that is the likely origin of the term. The earliest mention of "finesse" and "bluff" on the Board Game Geek forums comes from [Adam Kunsemiller's post in 2012](https://boardgamegeek.com/article/9317490#9317490). He uses the terms in a colloquial way, which implies that these strategies were commonly used at the time of writing.
* The specific inventors of some of our own strategies are listed below.
